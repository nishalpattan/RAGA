      "Ivacaftor use can lead to dramatic health improvements in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with gating mutations. Here, we report five instances of dramatic clinical decline following withdrawal of ivacaftor in three individuals with the G551D-CFTR mutation. In each case, the patient's lung function and symptoms rapidly deteriorated after cessation of treatment. Awareness of this phenomenon should inform both clinical practices as well as the design of future clinical trials of highly active CFTR modulators.\n",
      "One major breakthrough in cystic fibrosis research in the past decade is the development of drugs that target the root cause of the disease-dysfunctional CFTR protein. One of the compounds, Ivacaftor or Kalydeco, which has been approved for clinical use since 2012, acts by promoting the gating function of CFTR. Our recent studies have led to a gating model that features an energetic coupling between NBD dimerization and gate opening/closing in CFTR's TMDs. Based on this model, we showed that ATP analogs can enhance CFTR gating by facilitating NBD dimerization, whereas Ivacaftor works by stabilizing the open channel conformation of the TMDs. This latter idea also explains the near omnipotence of Ivacaftor. Furthermore, this model marks multiple approaches to synergistically boost the open probability of CFTR by influencing distinct molecular events that control gating conformational changes.\n",

      "The pathophysiology of obstructive pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, leads to the development of chronic infections in the respiratory tract. Thus, the symptomatic management of the disease requires, in particular, repetitive antibiotherapy. Besides these antibacterial treatments, certain pathologies, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, require the intake of many drugs. This simultaneous absorption may lead to undesired drug interactions. For example, Orkambi® (lumacaftor/Ivacaftor, Vertex), a pharmacological drug employed to treat F508del patients, cannot be used with antibiotics such as rifampicin or rifabutin (rifamycin family) which are necessary to treat Mycobacteriaceae. As far as gene therapy is concerned, bacteria and/or biofilm in the airways present an additional barrier for gene transfer. Thus, aerosol administrations of nanoparticles have to overcome many obstacles before allowing a cellular penetration of therapeutic compounds. This review focuses on the development of aerosol formulations adapted to the respiratory tract and its multiple barriers. Then, formulations that are currently used in clinical applications are summarized depending on the active molecule delivered. Finally, we focus on new therapeutic approaches to reduce possible drug interactions by transferring the antibacterial activity to the nanocarrier while ensuring the transfection efficiency.\n",
      "The effect of ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with recurrent pancreatitis is unknown. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of CF patients taking ivacaftor who had a history of recurrent pancreatitis. During the first three months of therapy, only one of the six patients had an episode of pancreatitis, which was managed on an outpatient basis. Between three and twelve months on ivacaftor therapy, none of the patients had recurrence of pancreatitis or required hospitalization. The use of ivacaftor was associated with a reduced frequency and recurrence rate of pancreatitis in CF patients.\n",

      "Approximately 50% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are heterozygous with a rare mutation on at least one allele. Several mutants exhibit functional defects, correctable by gating potentiators. Long-term exposure (≥24h) to the only available potentiator drug, VX-770, leads to the biochemical and functional downregulation of F508del-CFTR both in immortalized and primary human airway cells, and possibly other CF mutants, attenuating its beneficial effect. Based on these considerations, we wanted to determine the effect of chronic VX-770 exposure on the functional and biochemical expression of rare CF processing/gating mutants in human airway epithelia.Expression of CFTR2 mutants was monitored in the human bronchial epithelial cell line (CFBE41o-) and in patient-derived conditionally reprogrammed bronchial and nasal epithelia by short-circuit current measurements, cell surface ELISA and immunoblotting in the absence or presence of CFTR modulators. The VX-770 half-maximal effective (EC50) concentration for G551D-CFTR activation was ∼0.63 μM in human nasal epithelia, implying that comparable concentration is required in the lung to attain clinical benefit. Five of the twelve rare CFTR2 mutants were susceptible to ∼20-70% downregulation by chronic VX-770 exposure with an IC50 of ∼1-20 nM and to destabilization by other investigational potentiators, thereby diminishing the primary functional gain of CFTR modulators.Thus, chronic exposure to VX-770 and preclinical potentiators can destabilize CFTR2 mutants in human airway epithelial models in a mutation and compound specific manner. This highlights the importance of selecting potentiator drugs with minimal destabilizing effects on CF mutants, advocating a precision medicine approach.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, and the predominant mutation is termed Phe508del (F508del). Therapy for F508del‑CFTR patients is based on the use of Orkambi®, a combination of VX809 and VX770. However, though Orkambi leads to an improvement in the lung function of patients, a progressive reduction in its efficacy has been observed. In order to overcome this effect, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of matrine and the in‑house compound FD‑2 in increasing the action of VX809 and VX770. Fischer rat thyroid cells overexpressing F508del‑CFTR were treated with matrine, VX809 (corrector) and/or with a number of potentiators (VX770, FD‑1 and FD‑2). The results demonstrated that matrine was able to stimulate CFTR activity and, in association with FD‑2, increased the functionality of the channel in the presence of VX809. Based on these results, it may be hypothesized that FD‑2 may be a novel and more effective potentiator compared with VX770.\n",

      "With over 1900 variants reported in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), enhanced understanding of cystic fibrosis (CF) genotype-phenotype correlation represents an important and expanding area of research. The potentiator Ivacaftor has proven an effective treatment for a subset of individuals carrying missense variants, particularly those that impact CFTR gating. Therapeutic efforts have recently focused on correcting the basic defect resulting from the common F508del variant, as well as many less frequent missense alleles. Modest enhancement of F508del-CFTR function has been achieved by combining Ivacaftor with Lumacaftor, a compound that aids maturational processing of misfolded CFTR. Continued development of in silico and in vitro models will facilitate CFTR variant characterization and drug testing, thereby elucidating heterogeneity in the molecular pathogenesis, phenotype, and modulator responsiveness of CF.\n",

      "The disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a disturbance in the synthesis or function of the CFTR anion channel. Several types of small molecules geared to overcome the underlying defect in specific patient groups are in the clinical pipeline. Two drugs have obtained regulatory approval. The potentiator ivacaftor brings major clinical benefit in patients with CFTR protein expression at the cell membrane; the combination ivacaftor plus corrector lumacaftor brings a modest benefit for patients homozygous for the most common mutation F508del. The busy drug pipeline puts pressure on the finite CF patient population. Improving CFTR function in patients has at times yielded unexpected findings. The initial success with ivacaftor has set high expectations, has pushed drug prices sky high and has resulted in inequity in drug access.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder in which epithelium-generated fluid flow from the lung, intestine, and pancreas is impaired due to mutations disrupting CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel function. CF manifestations of the pancreas and lung are present in the vast majority of CF patients, and 15% of CF infants are born with obstructed gut or meconium ileus. However, constipation is a significantly underreported outcome of CF disease, affecting 47% of the CF patients, and management becomes critical in the wake of increasing life span of CF patients. In this study, we unraveled a potentially novel molecular role of a membrane-bound cyclic guanosine monophosphate-synthesizing (cGMP-synthesizing) intestinal enzyme, guanylate cyclase 2C (GCC) that could be targeted to ameliorate CF-associated intestinal fluid deficit. We demonstrated that GCC agonism results in functional rescue of murine F508del/F508del and R117H/R117H Cftr and CFTR mutants in CF patient-derived intestinal spheres. GCC coexpression and activation facilitated processing and ER exit of F508del CFTR and presented a potentially novel rescue modality in the intestine, similar to the CF corrector VX-809. Our findings identify GCC as a biological CFTR corrector and potentiator in the intestine.\n",
      "Air pollution stimulates airway epithelial secretion through a cholinergic reflex that is unaffected in cystic fibrosis (CF), yet a strong correlation is observed between passive smoke exposure in the home and impaired lung function in CF children. Our aim was to study the effects of low smoke concentrations on CFTR function in vitro. Cigarette smoke extract stimulated robust anion secretion that was transient, mediated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and dependent on cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation. Secretion was initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediated by at least two distinct pathways; autocrine activation of EP4 prostanoid receptors, and stimulation of Ca2+ store-operated cAMP signaling. The response was absent in cells expressing the most common disease-causing mutant F508del-CFTR. In addition to the initial secretion, prolonged exposure of non-CF bronchial epithelial cells to low levels of smoke also caused a gradual decline in CFTR functional expression. F508del-CFTR channels that had been rescued by the CF drug combination VX-809 (lumacaftor) + VX-770 (ivacaftor) were more sensitive to this downregulation than wild-type CFTR. The results suggest that CFTR-mediated secretion during acute cigarette smoke exposure initially protects the airway epithelium while prolonged exposure reduces CFTR functional expression and reduces the efficacy of CF drugs.\n",

      "The Human Genome Project and the &quot;-omics&quot; technologies will in future provide genetic maps and biosynthetic pathways permitting personalized medical interventions directed at maintaining or restoring wellbeing. This is reflected in the strategy aims of 4P medicine in being: predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory. The results obtained in the field of cystic fibrosis, with the cloning of CFTR gene, and use of Kalydeco®, have demonstrated how using the mentioned strategies could also have success in rare disease management. Kalydeco® is the emblematic example demonstrating the indispensable role of an active patient participation in fully achieving the P4 medicine goals. It is actually the patient involvement that will furnish the fundamental data necessary in defining molecular profiles specific to the health status of any patient. These molecular profiles will contribute in planning preventive, and/or therapeutic interventions aimed at maintaining, and/or restoring the health conditions. Hence, for a correct and effective implementation of P4 medicine, researchers and healthcare professionals should always consider the psychological experiences and characteristics of their patients and families; making them all participants in formulating an appropriate therapeutic path. In achieving this, it will not only be necessary to consider and use concepts of vulnerability and resilience, particularly in the rare disease field, where patient fragility is high, and caregivers are often faced with unique and difficult issues, never confronted before.\n",
      "CFTR, the channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF), is expressed by the biliary epithelium (i.e cholangiocytes) of the liver. Progressive clinical liver disease (CFLD) occurs in about 10% of CF patients and represents the third leading cause of death. Impaired secretion and inflammation contribute to CFLD, however the lack of human-derived experimental models has hampered the understanding of CFLD pathophysiology and the search for a cure. We have investigated the cellular mechanisms altered in human CF cholangiocytes using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from healthy controls and a ΔF508 CFTR patient. We have devised a novel protocol for the differentiation of human iPSC into polarized monolayers of cholangiocytes. Our results show that iPSC-cholangiocytes reproduced the polarity and the secretory function of the biliary epithelium. PKA/c-AMP mediated fluid secretion was impaired in ΔF508 cholangiocytes and negligibly improved by VX-770 and VX-809, two small molecule drugs used to correct and potentiate ΔF508 CFTR. Moreover, ΔF508 cholangiocytes showed increased phosphorylation of Src kinase and TLR4 and pro-inflammatory changes including increased NF-kB activation, secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines (i.e MCP-1 and IL8), as well as alterations of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Treatment with Src inhibitor (PP2) decreased the inflammatory changes and improved cytoskeletal defects. Inhibition of Src along with administration of VX-770 and VX-809 successfully restored fluid secretion to normal levels.\n",

      "Clinical studies with modulators of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein have demonstrated that functional restoration of the mutated CFTR can lead to substantial clinical benefit. However, studies have shown highly variable patient responses. The objective of this study was to determine a biomarker predictive of the clinical response. CFTR function was assessed in vivo via nasal potential difference (NPD) and in human nasal epithelial (HNE) cultures by the response to Forskolin/IBMX and the CFTR potentiator VX-770 in short-circuit-current (∆IscF/I+V) experiments. CFTR expression was evaluated by apical membrane fluorescence semi-quantification. Isc measurements discriminated CFTR function between controls, healthy heterozygotes, patients homozygous for the severe F508del mutation and patients with genotypes leading to absent or residual function. ∆IscF/I+V correlated with CFTR cellular apical expression and NPD measurements. The CFTR correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor significantly increased the ∆IscF/I+V response to about 25% (SEM = 4.4) of the WT-CFTR level and the CFTR apical expression to about 22% (SEM = 4.6) of the WT-CFTR level in F508del/F508del HNE cells. The level of CFTR correction in HNE cultures significantly correlated with the FEV1 change at 6 months in 8 patients treated with CFTR modulators. We provide the first evidence that correction of CFTR function in HNE cell cultures can predict respiratory improvement by CFTR modulators.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein in the epithelial membrane, and affects at least 30,000 people in the USA. There are between 900 and 1000 new cases diagnosed every year. Traditionally, CF has been treated symptomatically with pancreatic enzymes, bronchodilators, hypertonic saline, and pulmozyme. In July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), a combination drug that works on reversing the effects of the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. Orkambi and mucolytics decrease the viscosity of mucous secretions, leading to an accumulation of hypoviscous fluid in the alveoli, resulting in dyspnea. This presentation can be mistaken for an infective exacerbation. We present a case in which a young female with CF recently started on Orkambi therapy presented to her primary care physician with dyspnea and increased respiratory secretions and was admitted to the hospital for 2 weeks of intravenous and inhaled antibiotic therapy for a presumed CF exacerbation. We highlight this case to bring awareness and educate patients and clinicians of the side-effect profile of Orkambi therapy with an intent to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations, inpatient antibiotics, and other costly medical services.\n",

The potent activity of Ivacaftor in vivo is also demonstrated in a murine neutropenic thigh infection model. Taken together, these results support the potential of Ivacaftor as an antimicrobial agent for the treatment of staphylococcal infections.\n",
      "The combination therapy of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi(®)) is approved for patients bearing the major cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation: ΔF508 It has been predicted that Orkambi(®) could treat patients with rarer mutations of similar &quot;theratype&quot;; however, a standardized approach confirming efficacy in these cohorts has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that patients bearing the rare mutation: c.3700 A&gt;G, causing protein misprocessing and altered channel function-similar to ΔF508-CFTR, are unlikely to yield a robust Orkambi(®) response. While in silico and biochemical studies confirmed that this mutation could be corrected and potentiated by lumacaftor and ivacaftor, respectively, this combination led to a minor in vitro response in patient-derived tissue. A CRISPR/Cas9-edited bronchial epithelial cell line bearing this mutation enabled studies showing that an &quot;amplifier&quot; compound, effective in increasing the levels of immature CFTR protein, augmented the Orkambi(®) response. Importantly, this &quot;amplifier&quot; effect was recapitulated in patient-derived nasal cultures-providing the first evidence for its efficacy in augmenting Orkambi(®) in tissues harboring a rare CF-causing mutation. We propose that this multi-disciplinary approach, including creation of CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells to profile modulators together with validation using primary tissue, will facilitate therapy development for patients with rare CF mutations.\n",
      "There is a clear need for new antimicrobials to improve current treatment of chronic lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study determined the activities of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and ivacaftor, a novel CF transmembrane conductance regulator potentiator, for CF treatment. Antimicrobial activities of AMPs [LL37, human β-defensins (HβD) 1-4 and SLPI] and ivacaftor against clinical respiratory isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Achromobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined using radial diffusion and time-kill assays, respectively. Synergy of LL37 and ivacaftor with tobramycin was determined by time-kill, with in vivo activity of ivacaftor and tobramycin compared using a murine infection model. LL37 and HβD3 were the most active AMPs tested, with MICs ranging from 3.2- ≥ 200 mg/L and 4.8- ≥ 200 mg/L, respectively, except for Achromobacter that was resistant. HβD1 and SLPI demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. LL37 demonstrated synergy with tobramycin against 4/5 S. aureus and 2/5 Streptococcus spp. isolates. Ivacaftor demonstrated bactericidal activity against Streptococcus spp. (mean log10 decrease 3.31 CFU/mL) and bacteriostatic activity against S. aureus (mean log10 change 0.13 CFU/mL), but no activity against other genera. Moreover, ivacaftor demonstrated synergy with tobramycin, with mean log10 decreases of 5.72 CFU/mL and 5.53 CFU/mL at 24 h for S. aureus and Streptococcus spp., respectively. Ivacaftor demonstrated immunomodulatory but no antimicrobial activity in a P. aeruginosa in vivo murine infection model. Following further modulation to enhance activity, AMPs and ivacaftor offer real potential as therapeutics to augment antibiotic therapy of respiratory infection in CF.\n",

      "G551D, a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, results in impaired chloride channel function in cystic fibrosis (CF) with multiple end-organ manifestations. The effect of ivacaftor, a CFTR-potentiator, on exercise capacity in CF is unknown. Twenty G551D-CF patients were recruited to a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 28-day crossover study of ivacaftor. Variables measured included percentage change from baseline (%Δ) of VO2max (maximal oxygen consumption, primary outcome) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), relevant other CPET physiological variables, lung function, body mass index (BMI), sweat chloride and disease-specific health related quality of life (QOL) measures (CFQ-R and Alfred Wellness (AWEscore)). %ΔVO2max was unchanged compared with placebo as was %Δminute ventilation. However, %Δexercise time (mean 7.3, CI 0.5-14,1, P=0.0222) significantly increased as did %ΔFEV1 (11.7%, range 5.3-18.1, P&lt;0·005) and %ΔBMI (1.2%, range 0.1-2.3, P=0·0393) whereas sweat chloride decreased (mean -43.4; range -55.5-18.1 mmol·l(-1), P&lt;0·005). Total and activity based domains in both CFQ-R and AWEscore also increased. A positive treatment effect on spirometry, BMI (increased), SCT (decreased) and total and activity based CF-specific QOL measures was expected. However, the lack of discernible improvement in VO2max and VE despite other positive changes including spirometric lung function and exercise time with a 28-day ivacaftor intervention suggests that ventilatory parameters are not the sole driver of change in exercise capacity in this study cohort. Investigation over a more prolonged period may delineate the potential interdependencies of the observed discordances over time.\n",
      "Ivacaftor is currently used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis as both monotherapy (Kalydeco; Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA) and combination therapy with lumacaftor (Orkambi; Vertex Pharmaceuticals). Each therapy targets specific patient populations: Kalydeco treats patients carrying one of nine gating mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, whereas Orkambi treats patients homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation. In this study, we explored the pharmacological and metabolic effects of precision deuteration chemistry on ivacaftor by synthesizing two novel deuterated ivacaftor analogs, CTP-656 (d9-ivacaftor) and d18-ivacaftor. Ivacaftor is administered twice daily and is extensively converted in humans to major metabolites M1 and M6; therefore, the corresponding deuterated metabolites were also prepared. Both CTP-656 and d18-ivacaftor showed in vitro pharmacologic potency similar to that in ivacaftor, and the deuterated M1 and M6 metabolites showed pharmacology equivalent to that in the corresponding metabolites of ivacaftor, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies of deuterated compounds. However, CTP-656 exhibited markedly enhanced stability when tested in vitro. The deuterium isotope effects for CTP-656 metabolism ((D)V = 3.8, (D)V/K = 2.2) were notably large for a cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CTP-656 and d18-ivacaftor were assessed in six healthy volunteers in a single-dose crossover study, which provided the basis for advancing CTP-656 in development. The overall PK profile, including the 15.9-hour half-life for CTP-656, suggests that CTP-656 may be dosed once daily, thereby enhancing patient adherence. Together, these data continue to validate deuterium substitution as a viable approach for creating novel therapeutic agents with properties potentially differentiated from existing drugs.\n",

In these five patients, two experienced suicidal ideation and three made suicide attempts that resulted in psychiatric hospitalizations.\n",
      "Sphingomyelinase C (SMase) inhibits CFTR chloride channel activity in multiple cell systems, an effect that could exacerbate disease in CF and COPD patients. The mechanism by which sphingomyelin catalysis inhibits CFTR is not known but evidence suggests that it occurs independently of CFTR's regulatory &quot;R&quot; domain. In this study we utilized the Xenopus oocyte expression system to shed light on how CFTR channel activity is reduced by SMase. We found that the pathway leading to inhibition is not membrane delimited and that inhibited CFTR channels remain at the cell membrane, indicative of a novel silencing mechanism. Consistent with an effect on CFTR gating behavior, we found that altering gating kinetics influenced the sensitivity to inhibition by SMase. Specifically, increasing channel activity by introducing the mutation K1250A or pretreating with the CFTR potentiator VX-770 (Ivacaftor) imparted resistance to inhibition. In primary bronchial epithelial cells, we found that basolateral, but not apical, application of SMase leads to a redistribution of sphingomyelin and a reduction in forskolin- and VX-770-stimulated currents. Taken together, these data suggest that SMase inhibits CFTR channel function by locking channels into a closed state and that endogenous CFTR in HBEs is affected by SMase activity.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder affecting around 75,000 individuals worldwide. It is a multi-system disease but the main morbidity and mortality is caused by chronic lung disease. Due to newborn screening, a multidisciplinary approach to care and intensive symptomatic treatment, the prognosis has dramatically improved over the last decades and there are currently more adults than children in many countries. However, CF is still a very severe disease with a current median age of life expectancy in the fourth decade of life. The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which encodes the CFTR protein, a protein kinase A-activated ATP-gated anion channel that regulates the transport of electrolytes such as chloride and bicarbonate. More than 2000 mutations have been reported, although not all of these have functional consequences. An enormous research effort and progress has been made in understanding the consequences of these mutations on the CFTR protein structure and function, and this has led to the approval of two new drug therapies that are able to bind to defective CFTR proteins and partially restore their function. They are mutation-specific therapies and available at present for specific mutations only. They are the first personalized medicine for CF with a possible disease-modifying effect. A pipeline of other compounds is under development with different mechanisms of action. It is foreseeable that new combinations of compounds will further improve the correction of CFTR function. Other strategies including premature stop codon read-through drugs, antisense oligonucleotides that correct the basic defect at the mRNA level or gene editing to restore the defective gene as well as gene therapy approaches are all in the pipeline. All these strategies are needed to develop disease-modifying therapies for all patients with CF.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed ubiquitously throughout the body. Thus, while respiratory manifestations dominate much of cystic fibrosis (CF) care, there are prominent multi-organ manifestations and comorbidities. In the general population, the number of comorbidities increases with aging. Few illnesses have experienced such a dramatic improvement in survival as CF, which has been transformed from an illness of childhood death to one of adult survival. Hence, as longevity increases in CF, it is paralleled by an increasing number of patients with multicomplex comorbidities availing of care from adult CF multi-disciplinary teams. This review gives an overview of the traditional CF associated comorbidities and those emerging in an aging adult cohort. While historically the treatment of CF focused on the consequences of CFTR dysfunction, the recent advent of CFTR modulators with the potential to enhance CFTR function represents an opportunity to potentially reverse or delay the development of some of the comorbidities associated with CF. Where evidence is available for the impact of CFTR modulatory therapy, namely ivacaftor on comorbidities in CF, this is highlighted.\n",
      "Understanding the mechanism of action of modulator compounds for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is key for the optimization of therapeutics as well as obtaining insights into the molecular mechanisms of CFTR function. We demonstrate the direct binding of VX-809 to the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of human CFTR. Disruption of the interaction between C-terminal helices and the NBD1 core upon VX-809 binding is observed from chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra of residues in the helices and on the surface of β-strands S3, S9, and S10. Binding to VX-809 leads to a significant negative shift in NBD1 thermal melting temperature (Tm), pointing to direct VX-809 interaction shifting the NBD1 conformational equilibrium. An inter-residue correlation analysis of the chemical shift changes provides evidence of allosteric coupling between the direct binding site and the NBD1:CL4 interface, thus enabling effects on the interface in the absence of direct binding in that location. These NMR binding data and the negative Tm shifts are very similar to those previously reported by us for binding of the dual corrector-potentiator CFFT-001 to NBD1 (Hudson et al., 2012), suggesting that the two compounds may share some aspects of their mechanisms of action. Although previous studies have shown an important role for VX-809 in modulating the conformation of the first membrane spanning domain (Aleksandrov et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2013), this additional mode of VX-809 binding provides insight into conformational dynamics and allostery within CFTR.\n",
      "This is arguably the most exciting era in the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) with the emergence of potentially disease modifying therapies.

      "The combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) has been reported to induce a mean acute absolute drop of -4.1% predicted forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) after a unique administration in healthy subjects. The aim of the present study was to assess acute FEV1 changes after the first dose of LUM/IVA in CF patients. A total of 32 pediatric patients were included. Respiratory manifestations occurred in only 3 patients (9.4%), but FEV1 consistently decreased (-10.4±4.6%, range: -1.5; -21.8%). FEV1 only partially resumed after salbutamol inhalation. Patients with previously known significant reversible airway obstruction and low FEV1 were more at risk of FEV1 decrease.\n",

      "We optically measured effects of orally available ivacaftor (Kalydeco®) on sweat rates of identified glands in 3 R117H subjects, each having a unique set of additional mutations, and compared them with 5 healthy control subjects tested contemporaneously. We injected β-adrenergic agonists intradermally to stimulate CFTR-dependent 'C-sweat' and methacholine to stimulate 'M-sweat', which persists in CF subjects. We focused on an R117H-7T/F508del subject who produced quantifiable C-sweat off ivacaftor and was available for 1 blinded, 3 off ivacaftor, and 3 on ivacaftor tests, allowing us to estimate in vivo fold-increase in sweat rates produced by ivacaftor's effect on the open probability (PO) of R117H-CFTR. Measured sweat rates must be corrected for sweat losses. With estimated sweat losses of 0.023 to 0.08 nl·gland-1·min-1, ivacaftor increased the average C-sweat rates 3-7 fold, and estimated function as % of WT were 4.1-12% off ivacaftor and 21.9-32% on ivacaftor (larger values reflect increased loss estimates). Based on single tests, an R117H-7T/ R117H-7T subject showed 6-9% WT function off ivacaftor and 28-43% on ivacaftor. Repeat testing of an R117H-5T/F508del subject detected only trace responding to ivacaftor. We conclude that in vivo, R117H PO is strongly increased by ivacaftor, but channel number, mainly determined by variable deletion of exon 10, has a marked influence on outcomes.\n",

      "Ivacaftor was approved for rarer class-III CFTR mutations including S549N in 2014. Since these mutations are uncommon, ongoing reports of patient experiences with Ivacaftor and these mutations are important. This case series describes the clinical effectiveness (including airway infection status, lung function, and growth) of Ivacaftor therapy in four pediatric Hispanic patients with S549N and F508del over 24 months. In these patients, Ivacaftor was highly efficacious with no further Pseudomonas-positive cultures despite prior chronic colonization in three patients as well as notable improvements in lung function and growth. The remarkable improvements in lung function and growth were similar to G551D patients with more striking changes in airway infection status.

      "A large number of correctors have been identified that can partially repair defects in folding, stability and trafficking of CFTR processing mutants that cause cystic fibrosis (CF). The best corrector, VX-809 (Lumacaftor), has shown some promise when used in combination with a potentiator (Ivacaftor). Understanding the mechanism of VX-809 is essential for development of better correctors. Here, we tested our prediction that VX-809 repairs folding and processing defects of CFTR by promoting interactions between the first cytoplasmic loop (CL1) of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) and the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1). To investigate whether VX-809 promoted CL1/NBD1 interactions, we performed cysteine mutagenesis and disulfide cross-linking analysis of Cys-less TMD1 (residues 1-436) and ΔTMD1 (residues 437-1480; NBD1-R-TMD2-NBD2) truncation mutants. It was found that VX-809, but not bithiazole correctors, promoted maturation (exited endoplasmic reticulum for addition of complex carbohydrate in the Golgi) of the ΔTMD1 truncation mutant only when it was co-expressed in the presence of TMD1. Expression in the presence of VX-809 also promoted cross-linking between R170C (in CL1 of TMD1 protein) and L475C (in NBD1 of the ΔTMD1 truncation protein). Expression of the ΔTMD1 truncation mutant in the presence of TMD1 and VX-809 also increased the half-life of the mature protein in cells. The results suggest that the mechanism by which VX-809 promotes maturation and stability of CFTR is by promoting CL1/NBD1 interactions.\n",

      "Several members of the SLC26A family of anion transporters associate with CFTR, forming complexes in which CFTR and SLC26A functions are reciprocally regulated. These associations are thought to be facilitated by PDZ scaffolding interactions. CFTR has been shown to be positively regulated by NHERF-1, and negatively regulated by CAL in airway epithelia. However, it is unclear which PDZ-domain protein(s) interact with SLC26A9, a SLC26A family member found in airway epithelia. We have previously shown that primary, human bronchial epithelia (HBE) from non-CF donors exhibit constitutive anion secretion attributable to SLC26A9. However, constitutive anion secretion is absent in HBE from CF donors. We examined whether changes in SLC26A9 constitutive activity could be attributed to a loss of CFTR trafficking, and what role PDZ interactions played. HEK293 coexpressing SLC26A9 with the trafficking mutant F508del CFTR exhibited a significant reduction in constitutive current compared with cells coexpressing SLC26A9 and wt CFTR. We found that SLC26A9 exhibits complex glycosylation when coexpressed with F508del CFTR, but its expression at the plasma membrane is decreased. SLC26A9 interacted with both NHERF-1 and CAL, and its interaction with both significantly increased with coexpression of wt CFTR. However, coexpression with F508del CFTR only increased SLC26A9's interaction with CAL. Mutation of SLC26A9's PDZ motif decreased this association with CAL, and restored its constitutive activity. Correcting aberrant F508del CFTR trafficking in CF HBE with corrector VX-809 also restored SLC26A9 activity. We conclude that when SLC26A9 is coexpressed with F508del CFTR, its trafficking defect leads to a PDZ motif-sensitive intracellular retention of SLC26A9.\n",
      "Deletion of a single phenylalanine residue at position 508 of the protein CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), a chloride channel in lung epithelium, is the most common cause for cystic fibrosis. As a consequence, folding of the CFTRΔF508 protein and delivery to the cell surface are compromised, resulting in degradation of the polypeptide. Accordingly, decreased surface presence of CFTRΔF508 causes impaired chloride ion conductivity and is associated with mucus accumulation, a hallmark of cystic fibrosis. Molecular chaperones such as Hsp90 and its co-chaperone partner Aha1 are thought to play a key role in targeting folding-deficient CFTRΔF508 for degradation. Thus, pharmacologic manipulation to inhibit Hsp90-Aha1 chaperone complex formation appears beneficial to inhibit proteolysis of CFTRΔF508 and rescue its residual chloride channel activity. Therefore, we have screened a collection of 14,400 druglike chemical compounds for inhibitors of the Hsp90-Aha1 complex by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay (Alpha). We identified two druglike molecules that showed promising results when we tested their ability to restore chloride channel activity in culture cells expressing the mutant CFTRΔF508 protein. The two molecules were most effective in combination with the corrector VX-809 and may therefore serve as a lead compound that can be further developed into a drug to treat cystic fibrosis patients.\n",

      "Human ABC (ATP Binding Cassette) transporters form a superfamily of forty-eight transmembrane proteins, which transport their substrates across biological membranes against important concentration gradients, in an energy-dependent manner. Gene variations in approximately half of these transporters have been identified in subjects with rare and often severe genetic diseases, highlighting the importance of their biological function. For missense variations leading to defects in ABC transporters, the current challenge is to identify new molecules with therapeutic potential able to rescue the induced molecular deficiency. In this review, we first address the progress provided by emerging pharmacotherapies in cystic fibrosis, the most frequent monogenic disease caused by variations of an ABC transporter, i.e. ABCC7/CFTR. Then, we enlarge the topic to the other ABC transporters, more notably to canalicular ABC transporters, the variations of which cause rare hepatobiliary diseases, and we discuss the first promising attempts aiming to correct molecular defects of these proteins.\n",
      "The exocrine pancreatic insufficiency affects more than 80% of cystic fibrosis (CF) infants. Pancreatic insufficiency is diagnosed by low levels of fecal elastase. An optimal caloric intake, a pancreatic enzyme treatment are the keys to maintain a good nutritional status. The fat soluble vitamins supplementation will be associated with pancreatic enzymes treatment and will be adapted to plasma levels. Iron and oligo-element deficiency such as zinc is common. The pancreatic enzymes function is not optimal in the proximal bowel: the intraluminal intestinal pH is low because of the absence of bicarbonate release by the pancreas. The use of proton pump inhibitors may improve the functionality of pancreatic enzymes treatment. New therapies such as ivacaftor in patients with a G551D mutation allows a weight gain in particular by restoring intestinal pH similar to controls. Lengthening of the life expectancy of patients with CF is accompanied by the emergence new aspects of the disease, especially diabetes, favored by pancreatic cystic fibrosis resulting in an anatomical destruction of pancreatic islets. Currently, diabetes affects a third of the patients after 20 years, and half after 30 years. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is a major factor of morbidity-mortality in all stages of the disease and is characterized by a preclinical phase of glucose intolerance particularly long reaching up to 10 years. Its pathophysiology combines a lack of insulin secretion, an insulin resistance secondary to chronic infection, and a decrease in the production of the GIP and GLP-1. The insulin secretion depending on the channel chlorine (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator [CFTR]) activity at the membrane surface of insulin cell is reduced prior to the occurrence of pancreatic histological lesions. At the stage of diabetes, obtaining a normoglycemia by insulin treatment began very early allows to slow the decline of lung function and nutritional status. Given the silent phase of diabetes, screening it is recommended by the realization of an annual OGTT from 10 years of age, or before in severe forms of CF. New treatments of CF able to target CFTR showed their efficacy in slowing the decline of lung function, and could also contribute to slow or prevent the onset of diabetes.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis is realizing the promise of personalized medicine. Recent advances in drug development that target the causal CFTR directly result in lung function improvement, but variability in response is demanding better prediction of outcomes to improve management decisions. The genetic modifier SLC26A9 contributes to disease severity in the CF pancreas and intestine at birth and here we assess its relationship with disease severity and therapeutic response in the airways. SLC26A9 association with lung disease was assessed in individuals from the Canadian and French CF Gene Modifier consortia with CFTR-gating mutations and in those homozygous for the common Phe508del mutation. Variability in response to a CFTR-directed therapy attributed to SLC26A9 genotype was assessed in Canadian patients with gating mutations. A primary airway model system determined if SLC26A9 shows modification of Phe508del CFTR function upon treatment with a CFTR corrector. In those with gating mutations that retain cell surface-localized CFTR we show that SLC26A9 modifies lung function while this is not the case in individuals homozygous for Phe508del where cell surface expression is lacking. Treatment response to ivacaftor, which aims to improve CFTR-channel opening probability in patients with gating mutations, shows substantial variability in response, 28% of which can be explained by rs7512462 in SLC26A9 (P = 0.0006). When homozygous Phe508del primary bronchial cells are treated to restore surface CFTR, SLC26A9 likewise modifies treatment response (P = 0.02). Our findings indicate that SLC26A9 airway modification requires CFTR at the cell surface, and that a common variant in SLC26A9 may predict response to CFTR-directed therapeutics.\n",

      "In the healthy lung the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is rapidly eliminated by mucociliary clearance, a process that is dependent on the activity of the CFTR anion channel that, in concert with a number of other transport proteins, regulates the volume and composition of the periciliary surface liquid. This fluid layer is essential to enable cilia to clear pathogens from the lungs. However, in cystic fibrosis (CF), mutations in the CFTR gene reduce Cl(-) and [Formula: see text] secretion, thereby decreasing periciliary surface liquid volume and mucociliary clearance of bacteria. In CF this leads to persistent infection with the opportunistic pathogen, P. aeruginosa, which is the cause of reduced lung function and death in ~95% of CF patients. Others and we have conducted studies to elucidate the effects of P. aeruginosa on wild-type and Phe508del-CFTR Cl(-) secretion as well as on the host immune response. These studies have demonstrated that Cif (CFTR inhibitory factor), a virulence factor secreted by P. aeruginosa, is associated with reduced lung function in CF and induces the ubiquitination and degradation of wt-CFTR as well as TAP1, which plays a key role in viral and bacterial antigen presentation. Cif also enhances the degradation of Phe508del-CFTR that has been rescued by ORKAMBI, a drug approved for CF patients homozygous for the Phe508del-CFTR mutation, thereby reducing drug efficacy. This review is based on the Hans Ussing Distinguished Lecture at the 2016 Experimental Biology Meeting given by the author.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations that disrupt the plasma membrane expression, stability, and function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel. Two small molecules, the CFTR corrector lumacaftor and the potentiator ivacaftor, are now used clinically to treat CF, although some studies suggest that they have counteracting effects on CFTR stability. Here, we investigated the impact of these compounds on the instability of F508del-CFTR, the most common CF mutation. To study individual CFTR Cl(-) channels, we performed single-channel recording, whereas to assess entire CFTR populations, we used purified CFTR proteins and macroscopic CFTR Cl(-) currents. At 37 °C, low temperature-rescued F508del-CFTR more rapidly lost function in cell-free membrane patches and showed altered channel gating and current flow through open channels. Compared with purified wild-type CFTR, the full-length F508del-CFTR was about 10 °C less thermostable. Lumacaftor partially stabilized purified full-length F508del-CFTR and slightly delayed deactivation of individual F508del-CFTR Cl(-) channels. By contrast, ivacaftor further destabilized full-length F508del-CFTR and accelerated channel deactivation. Chronic (prolonged) co-incubation of F508del-CFTR-expressing cells with lumacaftor and ivacaftor deactivated macroscopic F508del-CFTR Cl(-) currents. However, at the single-channel level, chronic co-incubation greatly increased F508del-CFTR channel activity and temporal stability in most, but not all, cell-free membrane patches. We conclude that chronic lumacaftor and ivacaftor co-treatment restores stability in a small subpopulation of F508del-CFTR Cl(-) channels but that the majority remain destabilized. A fuller understanding of these effects and the characterization of the small F508del-CFTR subpopulation might be crucial for CF therapy development.\n",

      "ABCB4 (MDR3) is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter expressed at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, where it mediates phosphatidylcholine (PC) secretion. Variations in the ABCB4 gene are responsible for several biliary diseases, including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3), a rare disease that can be lethal in the absence of liver transplantation. In this study, we investigated the effect and potential rescue of ABCB4 missense variations that reside in the highly conserved motifs of ABC transporters, involved in ATP binding. Five disease-causing variations in these motifs have been identified in ABCB4 (G535D, G536R, S1076C, S1176L, and G1178S), three of which are homologous to the gating mutations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR or ABCC7; i.e., G551D, S1251N, and G1349D), that were previously shown to be function defective and corrected by ivacaftor (VX-770; Kalydeco), a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. Three-dimensional structural modeling predicted that all five ABCB4 variants would disrupt critical interactions in the binding of ATP and thereby impair ATP-induced nucleotide-binding domain dimerization and ABCB4 function. This prediction was confirmed by expression in cell models, which showed that the ABCB4 mutants were normally processed and targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas their PC secretion activity was dramatically decreased. As also hypothesized on the basis of molecular modeling, PC secretion activity of the mutants was rescued by the CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor (VX-770).\n",

      "Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) result in the disease cystic fibrosis. Deletion of Phe508, the most prevalent mutation associated with this disease, disrupts trafficking of the protein. Small molecule correctors yield moderate improvements in the trafficking of ΔF508-CFTR to the plasma membrane. It is currently not known if correctors increase the level of trafficking through improved cargo loading of transport vesicles or through direct binding to CFTR. Real-time measurements of trafficking were utilized to identify the mechanistic details of chemical, biochemical, and thermal factors that impact CFTR correction, using the corrector molecule VX-809, a secondary mutation (I539T), and low-temperature conditions. Each individually improved trafficking of ΔF508-CFTR to approximately 10% of wild-type levels. The combination of VX-809 with either low temperature or the I539T mutation increased the amount of CFTR on the plasma membrane to nearly 40%, indicating synergistic activity. The number of vesicles reaching the surface was significantly altered; however, the amount of channel in each vesicle remained the same. Direct binding measurements of VX-809 in native membranes using backscattering interferometry indicate tight binding to CFTR, which occurred in a manner independent of mutation. The similar values obtained for all forms of the channel indicate that the binding site is not compromised or enhanced by these mutations.\n",

      "Well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell cultures are vital for cystic fibrosis (CF) research, particularly for the development of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drugs. Culturing of epithelial cells with irradiated 3T3 fibroblast feeder cells plus the RhoA kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Y), termed conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) technology, enhances cell growth and lifespan while preserving cell-of-origin functionality. We initially determined the electrophysiological and morphological characteristics of conventional versus CRC-expanded non-CF HBE cells. On the basis of these findings, we then created six CF cell CRC populations, three from sequentially obtained CF lungs and three from F508 del homozygous donors previously obtained and cryopreserved using conventional culture methods. Growth curves were plotted, and cells were subcultured, without irradiated feeders plus Y, into air-liquid interface conditions in nonproprietary and proprietary Ultroser G-containing media and were allowed to differentiate. Ussing chamber studies were performed after treatment of F508 del homozygous CF cells with the CFTR modulator VX-809. Bronchial epithelial cells grew exponentially in feeders plus Y, dramatically surpassing the numbers of conventionally grown cells. Passage 5 and 10 CRC HBE cells formed confluent mucociliary air-liquid interface cultures. There were differences in cell morphology and current magnitude as a function of extended passage, but the effect of VX-809 in increasing CFTR function was significant in CRC-expanded F508 del HBE cells. Thus, CRC technology expands the supply of functional primary CF HBE cells for testing CFTR modulators in Ussing chambers.\n",
      "A depressed autophagy has previously been reported in cystic fibrosis patients with the common F508del-CFTR mutation. This report describes the synthesis and preliminary biological characterization of a novel series of autophagy activators involving fatty acid cysteamine conjugates. These molecular entities were synthesized by first covalently linking cysteamine to docosahexaenoic acid. The resulting conjugate 1 synergistically activated autophagy in primary homozygous F508del-CFTR human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells at submicromolar concentrations. When conjugate 1 was used in combination with the corrector lumacaftor and the potentiator ivacaftor, it showed an additive effect, as measured by the increase in the chloride current in a functional assay. In order to obtain a more stable form for oral dosing, the sulfhydryl group in conjugate 1 was converted into a functionalized disulfide moiety. The resulting conjugate 5 is orally bioavailable in the mouse, rat, and dog and allows a sustained delivery of the biologically active conjugate 1.\n",

      "W1282X is the fifth most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutation that causes cystic fibrosis. Here, we investigated the utility of a small molecule corrector/potentiator strategy, as used for ΔF508-CFTR, to produce functional rescue of the truncated translation product of the W1282X mutation, CFTR1281, without the need for read-through. In transfected cell systems, certain potentiators and correctors, including VX-809 and VX-770, increased CFTR1281 activity. To identify novel correctors and potentiators with potentially greater efficacy on CFTR1281, functional screens were done of ∼30,000 synthetic small molecules and drugs/nutraceuticals in CFTR1281-transfected cells. Corrector scaffolds of 1-arylpyrazole-4-arylsulfonyl-piperazine and spiro-piperidine-quinazolinone classes were identified with up to ∼5-fold greater efficacy than VX-809, some of which were selective for CFTR1281, whereas others also corrected ΔF508-CFTR. Several novel potentiator scaffolds were identified with efficacy comparable with VX-770; remarkably, a phenylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine acted synergistically with VX-770 to increase CFTR1281 function ∼8-fold over that of VX-770 alone, normalizing CFTR1281 channel activity to that of wild type CFTR. Corrector and potentiator combinations were tested in primary cultures and conditionally reprogrammed cells generated from nasal brushings from one W1282X homozygous subject. Although robust chloride conductance was seen with correctors and potentiators in homozygous ΔF508 cells, increased chloride conductance was not found in W1282X cells despite the presence of adequate transcript levels. Notwithstanding the negative data in W1282X cells from one human subject, we speculate that corrector and potentiator combinations may have therapeutic efficacy in cystic fibrosis caused by the W1282X mutation, although additional studies are needed on human cells from W1282X subjects.\n",
      "In an open-label, single-center phase 1 pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects who received lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with ivacaftor (IVA), review of spirometry data showed a transient decline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1s (ppFEV1) within 4h of drug administration. An additional cohort of healthy subjects with normal baseline ppFEV1 values was studied to evaluate the ppFEV1 response to LUM/IVA administration and assess the effect of long-acting bronchodilators (LABDs) and short-acting bronchodilators (SABDs) on ppFEV1 response. The ppFEV1 decline observed at 4h was attenuated following administration of an LABD and reversed following administration of an SABD. Concomitant administration of LUM/IVA with bronchodilators was well tolerated. These data show that a transient decline in ppFEV1 was observed in healthy subjects following administration of LUM/IVA combination therapy, which can be ameliorated with LABDs or SABDs.\n",

      "As a follow up to previous reviews, the aim of the present analysis was to systematically examine all drug metabolism, transport, pharmacokinetics (PK), and drug-drug interaction (DDI) data available in the 33 new drug applications (NDAs) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015, using the University of Washington Drug Interaction Database, and to highlight the significant findings. In vitro, a majority of the new molecular entities (NMEs) were found to be substrates or inhibitors/inducers of at least one drug metabolizing enzyme or transporter. In vivo, 95 clinical DDI studies displayed positive PK interactions, with an area under the curve (AUC) ratio ≥ 1.25 for inhibition or ≤ 0.8 for induction. When NMEs were considered as victim drugs, 21 NMEs had at least one positive clinical DDI, with three NMEs shown to be sensitive substrates of CYP3A (AUC ratio ≥ 5 when coadministered with strong inhibitors): cobimetinib, isavuconazole (the active metabolite of prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate), and ivabradine. As perpetrators, nine NMEs showed positive inhibition and three NMEs showed positive induction, with some of these interactions involving both enzymes and transporters. The most significant changes for inhibition and induction were observed with rolapitant, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and lumacaftor, a strong inducer of CYP3A. Physiologically based pharmacokinetics simulations and pharmacogenetics studies were used for six and eight NMEs, respectively, to inform dosing recommendations. The effects of hepatic or renal impairment on the drugs' PK were also evaluated to support drug administration in these specific populations.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting disease caused by defective or deficient cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity. The recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of lumacaftor combined with ivacaftor (Orkambi) targets patients with the F508del-CFTR. The question remains: Is this breakthrough combination therapy the &quot;magic-bullet&quot; cure for the vast majority of patients with CF? This review covers the contemporary clinical and scientific knowledge-base for lumacaftor/ivacaftor and highlights the emerging issues from recent conflicting literature reports.\n",

      "ORKAMBI (ivacaftor-lumacaftor [LUMA]) and KALYDECO (ivacaftor; IVA) are two new breakthrough cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs that directly modulate the activity and trafficking of the defective CFTR underlying the CF disease state. Currently, no therapeutic drug monitoring assays exist for these very expensive, albeit, important drugs. In this study, for the first time HPLC and LC-MS methods were developed and validated for rapid detection and quantification of IVA and its major metabolites hydroxymethyl-IVA M1 (active) and IVA-carboxylate M6 (inactive); and LUMA in the plasma and sputum of CF patients. With a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/water:0.1% formic acid (60:40v/v) at a flow rate of 1mL/min, a linear correlation was observed over a concentration range from 0.01 to 10μg/mL in human plasma (IVA R(2)&gt;0.999, IVA M1 R(2)&gt;0.9961, IVA M6 R(2)&gt;0.9898, LUMA R(2)&gt;0.9954). The assay was successfully utilized to quantify the concentration of LUMA, IVA, M1 and M6 in the plasma and sputum of CF patients undergoing therapy with KALYDECO (IVA 150mg/q12h) or ORKAMBI (200mg/q12h LUMA-125mg/q12h IVA). The KALYDECO patient exhibited an IVA plasma concentration of 0.97μg/mL at 2.5h post dosage. M1 and M6 plasma concentrations were 0.50μg/mL and 0.16μg/mL, respectively. Surprisingly, the ORKAMBI patient displayed very low plasma concentrations of IVA (0.06μg/mL) and M1 (0.07μg/mL). The M6 concentrations (0.15μg/mL) were comparable to those of the KALYDECO patient. However, we observed a relatively high plasma concentration of LUMA (4.42μg/mL). This reliable and novel method offers a simple and sensitive approach for therapeutic drug monitoring of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI in plasma and sputum. The introduction of the assay into the clinical setting will facilitate pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic analysis and assist clinicians to develop more cost effective and efficacious dosage regimens for these breakthrough CF drugs.\n",
      "Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, has been found to improve CFTR function and clinical outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) gating mutations. We investigated the effects of ivacaftor on CFTR functional measurement in CF patients carrying gating mutations other than p.Gly551Asp. Two siblings aged 13 and 12 carrying the p.Ser549Asn mutation, two sisters (45 and 43years old) compound heterozygotes for p.Asp1152His and p.Gly1244Glu, a 37year old man homozygous for the p.Gly1244Glu mutation, and a 7year old girl with p.Arg352Gln and p.Gly1244Glu mutations commenced treatment with ivacaftor. NPD was performed in all the patients and approached normal for four patients who had also clinical improvement (p.Ser549Asn compound heterozygotes, and p.Asp1152His/p.Gly1244Glu siblings). Beta-adrenergic sweat chloride secretion performed in thep.Asp1152His/p.Gly1244Glu patients improved significantly. The p.Gly1244Glu mutation homozygous patient, who had undergone an ileal resection with ileostomy and enterocutaneous fistula, did not respond clinically to ivacaftor and did not modify his sweat test. These results highlight the importance of different CFTR activity measurements to explore CFTR modulator efficacy.\n",
      "Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that enhances chloride transport by acting directly on CFTR to increase its channel gating activity, has been evaluated in patients with different CFTR mutations. Several previous analyses have reported no statistical correlation between change from baseline in ppFEV1 and reduction in sweat chloride levels for individuals treated with ivacaftor. The objective of the post hoc analysis described here was to expand upon previous analyses and evaluate the correlation between sweat chloride levels and absolute ppFEV1 changes across multiple cohorts of patients with different CF-causing mutations who were treated with ivacaftor. The goal of the analysis was to help define the potential value of sweat chloride as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for use in CFTR modulator trials. For any given study, reductions in sweat chloride levels and improvements in absolute ppFEV1 were not correlated for individual patients. However, when the data from all studies were combined, a statistically significant correlation between sweat chloride levels and ppFEV1 changes was observed (p&lt;0.0001). Thus, sweat chloride level changes in response to potentiation of the CFTR protein by ivacaftor appear to be a predictive pharmacodynamic biomarker of lung function changes on a population basis but are unsuitable for the prediction of treatment benefits for individuals.\n",

      "Beta-adrenergically-stimulated sweat rates determined by evaporimetry or by sweat bubble imaging are useful for measuring CFTR function because they provide a near-linear readout across almost the full range of CFTR function. They differentiate cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects from CF carriers and carriers from controls. However, evaporimetry, unlike bubble imaging, appears to be unable to detect improved levels of CFTR function in G551D subjects taking the CFTR modulator ivacaftor. Here, we quantify the sensitivity of evaporimetry and bubble imaging methods for assessing low levels of CFTR-dependent sweat rates. To establish sensitivity, we did dose-ranging studies using intradermally injected [cAMP]i-elevating cocktails. We reduced isoproterenol/aminophylline levels while maintaining a high level of atropine to block muscarinic elevation of [Ca2+]i. We stimulated the same sets of glands for both assays and recorded responses for 20 min. In response to a 3-log dilution of the stimulating cocktail (0.1%), bubble responses were detected in 12/12 tests (100%), with 49% ± 3% of glands secreting to produce an aggregate volume of 598 nl across the 12, 20-min tests. This was ~5% of the response to full cocktail. Evaporimetry detected responses in 3/12 (25%) tests with an aggregate secretion volume of 175 nl. After stimulation with a still more dilute cocktail (0.03%), bubble imaging detected 15 ± 13% of glands secreting at a rate ~0.9% of the response to full cocktail, while zero responding was seen with evaporimetry. The bubble imaging method detected secretion down to aggregate rates of &lt;0.2 nl/(cm2·min), or ~1/30th of the average basal transepithelial water loss (TEWL) in the test subject of 4 g/m2·hr or 6.7 nl/(cm2·min). The increased sensitivity of bubble imaging may be required to detect small but physiologically important increases in secretion rates produced by CFTR modulators.\n",
      "Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a common problem in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), the etiology of which is multifactorial. In this study, we provide the first evidence that ivacaftor improves BMD in CF patients carrying the p.Gly551Asp mutation. Consistently, in vitro experiments with TNF-α-stimulated primary F508del-CFTR osteoblasts demonstrated that correction of p.Phe508del-CFTR markedly decreased RANKL protein production, a major factor of bone resorption. These clinical and fundamental observations suggest that rescue of mutated CFTR protein improves bone remodeling and support the link between CFTR and bone cell physiology. These findings represent a step forward in the development of potential new therapies for CF-related bone disease.\n",
      "Premature termination codons (PTCs) in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene result in nonfunctional CFTR protein and are the proximate cause of ~11% of CF causing alleles. Aminoglycosides and other novel agents are known to induce translational readthrough of PTCs, a potential therapeutic approach. Among PTCs, W1282X CFTR is unique, as it is a C-terminal CFTR mutation that can exhibit partial activity, even in the truncated state. The potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770) is approved for treating CF patients with G551D and other gating mutations. Based on previous studies demonstrating the beneficial effect of ivacaftor for PTC mutations following readthrough in vitro, we hypothesized that ivacaftor may enhance CFTR activity in CF patients expressing W1282X CFTR, and could be further enhanced by readthrough. Ivacaftor significantly increased CFTR activity in W1282X-expressing cells compared to R1162X CFTR cells, and was further enhanced by readthrough with the aminoglycoside G418. Primary nasal epithelial cells from a W1282X homozygous patient showed improved CFTR function in the presence of ivacaftor. Upon ivacaftor administration to the same patient, there was significant improvement in pulmonary exacerbation frequency, BMI, and insulin requirement, whereas FEV1 remained stable over 3years. These studies suggest that ivacaftor may have moderate clinical benefit in patients with preserved expression of the W1282X CFTR mutation by stimulating residual activity of the truncated protein, suggesting the need for further studies including the addition of efficacious readthrough agents.\n",
      "Mutations of the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common recessive monogenic disease worldwide. These mutations alter the synthesis, processing, function, or half-life of CFTR, the main chloride channel expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the airway, intestine, pancreas, and reproductive tract. Lung disease is the most critical manifestation of CF. It is characterized by airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation that lead to fatal tissue destruction. In spite of great advances in early and multidisciplinary medical care, and in our understanding of the pathophysiology, CF is still considerably reducing the life expectancy of patients. This review highlights the current development in pharmacological modulators of CFTR, which aim at rescuing the expression and/or function of mutated CFTR. While only Kalydeco® and Orkambi® are currently available to patients, many other families of CFTR modulators are undergoing preclinical and clinical investigations. Drug repositioning and personalized medicine are particularly detailed in this review as they represent the most promising strategies for restoring CFTR function in CF.\n",
      "This review seeks to re-introduce cystic fibrosis (CF) clinicians to the pharmacology of drug-drug interactions among medications commonly used in CF and provide a framework for understanding these interactions among medications outside the scope of this discussion. We here focus on drugs impacted by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzyme system and on interactions involving antimicrobials, psychotropic medications, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. Particular attention is needed when prescribing rifampin, azole antifungals and the CFTR modulators, ivacaftor, and lumacaftor/ivacaftor, in combination with other medications. The complexities of these interactions provide a strong rationale for case management by pharmacists and pharmacologists as a routine part of CF care.

      "Emerging knowledge indicates the difficulty in categorizing unusual cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations, with regard to both pathogenic mechanism and theratype. As case in point, we present data concerning P67L mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a defect carried by a small number of individuals with CF and sometimes attributed to a channel conductance abnormality. Findings from our laboratory and others establish that P67L causes protein misfolding, disrupts maturation, confers gating defects, is thermally stable, and exhibits near normal conductance. These results provide one framework by which rare CF alleles such as P67L can be more comprehensively profiled vis-à-vis molecular pathogenesis. We also demonstrate that emerging CF treatments - ivacaftor and lumacaftor - can mediate pronounced pharmacologic activation of P67L CFTR. Infrequent CF alleles are often improperly characterized, in part, due to the small numbers of patients involved. Moreover, access to new personalized treatments among patients with ultra-orphan genotypes has been limited by difficulty arranging phase III clinical trials, and off-label prescribing has been impaired by high drug cost and difficulty arranging third party reimbursement. Rare CFTR mutations such as P67L are emblematic of the challenges to &quot;precision&quot; medicine, including use of the best available mechanistic knowledge to treat patients with unusual forms of disease.\n",

      "Novel combination therapies are desperately needed for combating lung infections caused by bacterial &quot;superbugs&quot;. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic antibacterial activity of polymyxin B in combination with the cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs KALYDECO (ivacaftor) and ORKAMBI (ivacaftor + lumacaftor) against Gram-negative pathogens that commonly colonize the CF lung, in particular, the problematic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro synergistic activity of polymyxin B combined with ivacaftor or lumacaftor was assessed using checkerboard and static time-kill assays against a panel of polymyxin-susceptible and polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates from the lungs of CF patients. Polymyxin B, ivacaftor, and lumacaftor were ineffective when used individually against polymyxin-resistant (MIC ≥ 4 mg/L) isolates. However, when used together, the combination of clinically relevant concentrations of polymyxin B (2 mg/L) combined with ivacaftor (8 mg/L) or ivacaftor (8 mg/L) + lumacaftor (8 mg/L) displayed synergistic killing activity against polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates as demonstrated by a 100-fold decrease in the bacterial count (CFU/mL) even after 24 h. The combinations also displayed excellent antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa under CF relevant conditions in a sputum medium assay. The combination of lumacaftor (alone) with polymyxin B showed additivity against P. aeruginosa. The potential antimicrobial mode of action of the combinations against P. aeruginosa was investigated using different methods. Treatment with the combinations induced cytosolic GFP release from P. aeruginosa cells and showed permeabilizing activity in the nitrocefin assay, indicating damage to both the outer and inner Gram-negative cell membranes. Moreover, scanning and transmission electron micrographs revealed that the combinations produce outer membrane damage to P. aeruginosa cells that is distinct from the effect of each compound per se. Ivacaftor was also shown to be a weak inhibitor of the bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV with no effect on either human type I or type IIα topoisomerases. Lumacaftor displayed the ability to increase the cellular production of damaging reactive oxygen species. In summary, the combination of polymyxin B with KALYDECO or ORKAMBI exhibited synergistic activity against highly polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa CF isolates and can be potentially useful for otherwise untreatable CF lung infections.\n",
      "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del), disrupts tertiary assembly, causing protein misprocessing and loss of CFTR function in epithelial tissues. Lumacaftor (VX-809) is a Class 1 corrector molecule shown to partially rescue misprocessing of F508del and together with the potentiator of channel activity: ivacaftor (VX-770) has been approved for treatment of CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation. The specificity of these modulators for CFTR is thought to be conferred through direct binding. Trimethylangelicin (TMA) is a distinct small molecule modulator, previously shown to exhibit both corrector and potentiator activities. We were prompted to determine if TMA also mediates these activities by direct binding. Interestingly, we found that like VX-770, TMA was effective in enhancing anion efflux mediated by purified WT-CFTR reconstituted in phospholipid liposomes. Furthermore, like VX-809, TMA was effective in stabilizing the functional expression of CFTR lacking the regulatory &quot;R&quot; domain or second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2). The smallest domain that was stabilized by TMA binding was the first membrane-spanning domain (MSD1) as previously observed for VX-809. Together, our findings support the claim that TMA binds directly to CFTR, and despite its distinct chemical structure, shares similar mechanisms as VX-770 and VX-809 to potentiate and stabilize CFTR, respectively.\n",
      "Acquired cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction may contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis and is a potential therapeutic target. We sought to determine the acute effects of cigarette smoke on ion transport and the mucociliary transport apparatus, their mechanistic basis, and whether deleterious effects could be reversed with the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770). Primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and human bronchi were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and/or ivacaftor. CFTR function and expression were measured in Ussing chambers and by surface biotinylation. CSE-derived acrolein modifications on CFTR were determined by mass spectroscopic analysis of purified protein, and the functional microanatomy of the airway epithelia was measured by 1-μm resolution optical coherence tomography. CSE reduced CFTR-dependent current in HBE cells (P &lt; 0.05) and human bronchi (P &lt; 0.05) within minutes of exposure. The mechanism involved CSE-induced reduction of CFTR gating, decreasing CFTR open-channel probability by approximately 75% immediately after exposure (P &lt; 0.05), whereas surface CFTR expression was partially reduced with chronic exposure, but was stable acutely. CSE treatment of purified CFTR resulted in acrolein modifications on lysine and cysteine residues that likely disrupt CFTR gating. In primary HBE cells, CSE reduced airway surface liquid depth (P &lt; 0.05) and ciliary beat frequency (P &lt; 0.05) within 60 minutes that was restored by coadministration with ivacaftor (P &lt; 0.005). Cigarette smoking transmits acute reductions in CFTR activity, adversely affecting the airway surface. These effects are reversible by a CFTR potentiator in vitro, representing a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic bronchitis.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is genetic autosomal recessive disease caused by reduced or absent function of CFTR protein. Treatments for patients with CF have primarily focused on the downstream end-organ consequences of defective CFTR. Since the discovery of the CFTR gene that causes CF in 1989 there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of CF. This has recently led to the development of new CFTR mutation-specific targeted therapies for select patients with CF. This review will discuss the characteristics of the CFTR gene, the CFTR mutations that cause CF and the new mutation specific pharmacological treatments including gene therapy that are contributing to the dawning of a new era in cystic fibrosis care.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) results from mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which codes for the CFTR channel protein. The most common mutation in CF is F508del, which produces a misfolded protein with diminished channel activity. The development of small-molecule CFTR-modulator compounds offers an exciting and novel approach for pharmacological treatment of CF. The corrector lumacaftor helps rescue F508del-CFTR to the cell surface, and potentiator ivacaftor increases F508del-CFTR channel activity. The combination of lumacaftor-ivacaftor (Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) represents the first FDA-approved therapy for CF patients with two copies of the F508del mutation. Although this combination therapy is the first treatment to directly target the F508del-CFTR mutation, patients taking this drug displayed only modest improvements in lung function. This article summarizes recent data from clinical trials and research discoveries relating to the lumacaftor-ivacaftor treatment, and considers options for identifying future therapies that will be most efficacious for all CF patients.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding a phosphorylation-activated but ATP-gated chloride channel. Previous studies suggested that VX-770 [ivacaftor, N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide], a CFTR potentiator now used in clinics, increases the open probability of CFTR by shifting the gating conformational changes to favor the open channel configuration. Recently the chloride channel blocker and CFTR potentiator 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoate (NPPB) has been reported to enhance CFTR activity by a mechanism that exploits the ATP hydrolysis-driven, nonequilibrium gating mechanism unique to CFTR. Surprisingly however, NPPB increased the activity of nonhydrolytic G551D-CFTR, the third most common disease-associated mutation. Here, we further investigated the mechanism of NPPB's effects on CFTR gating by assessing its interaction with well-studied VX-770. Interestingly, once G551D-CFTR was maximally potentiated by VX-770, NPPB further increased its activity. However, quantitative analysis of this drug-drug interaction suggests that this pharmacologic synergism is not due to independent actions of NPPB and VX-770 on CFTR gating; instead, our data support a dependent mechanism involving two distinct binding sites. This latter idea is further supported by the observation that the locked-open time of a hydrolysis-deficient mutant K1250A was shortened by NPPB but prolonged by VX-770. In addition, the effectiveness of NPPB, but not of VX-770, was greatly diminished in a mutant whose second nucleotide-binding domain was completely removed. Interpreting these results under the framework of current understanding of CFTR gating not only reveals insights into the mechanism of action for different CFTR potentiators but also brings us one step forward to a more complete schematic for CFTR gating.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal recessive genetic disease caused primarily by the F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The potentiator VX-770 was the first CFTR modulator approved by the FDA for treatment of CF patients with the gating mutation G551D. Orkambi is a drug containing VX-770 and corrector VX809 and is approved for treatment of CF patients homozygous for F508del, which has folding and gating defects. At least 30% of CF patients are heterozygous for the F508del mutation with the other allele encoding for one of many different rare CFTR mutations. Treatment of heterozygous F508del patients with VX-809 and VX-770 has had limited success, so it is important to identify heterozygous patients that respond to CFTR modulator therapy. R117H is a more prevalent rare mutation found in over 2,000 CF patients. In this study we investigated the effectiveness of VX-809/VX-770 therapy on restoring CFTR function in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from R117H/F508del CF patients. We found that VX-809 stimulated more CFTR activity in R117H/F508del HBEs than in F508del/F508del HBEs. R117H expressed exclusively in immortalized HBEs exhibited a folding defect, was retained in the ER, and degraded prematurely. VX-809 corrected the R117H folding defect and restored channel function. Because R117 is involved in ion conductance, VX-770 acted additively with VX-809 to restore CFTR function in chronically treated R117H/F508del cells. Although treatment of R117H patients with VX-770 has been approved, our studies indicate that Orkambi may be more beneficial for rescue of CFTR function in these patients.\n",
      "Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi™) is a fixed-dose tablet containing a corrector (lumacaftor) and potentiator (ivacaftor) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and is the first therapy approved to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in patients (aged ≥12 years) homozygous for the most common CFTR mutation, F508del. Lumacaftor improves the processing of F508del CFTR and its transport to the cell surface, while ivacaftor increases the channel's open probability and transport of chloride. In two 24-week trials in the approved patient population (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT), lumacaftor 400 mg plus ivacaftor 250 mg, administered every 12 h in combination with standard therapy, was associated with an ≈3 % statistically significant improvement in lung function relative to placebo (as measured by the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s). Lumacaftor plus ivacaftor did not significantly improve respiratory symptoms, although reduced pulmonary exacerbations to a clinically meaningful extent and, in one trial (TRANSPORT), significantly improved body mass index (BMI). In an ongoing extension of these studies (PROGRESS), lumacaftor plus ivacaftor provided clinical benefit over a further 72 weeks of treatment. Lumacaftor plus ivacaftor had an acceptable tolerability profile, with the most common adverse events being respiratory or gastrointestinal in nature. Thus, lumacaftor/ivacaftor expands the treatment options available for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, although its precise place in clinical practice remains to be determined.\n",
      "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is highly prevalent in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and accounts for significant morbidity and contribution to CF lung disease. Mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene occur with increased prevalence in patients with CRS without CF, suggesting some contribution to CRS pathophysiology. Nasal polyps (NPs) occur with increased prevalence in patients with CF of all ages and have a more neutrophilic appearance with fewer eosinophils and increased submucosal glandular elements in comparison to NPs from patients without CF. Mainstays of medical treatment include isotonic saline irrigations and topical intranasal glucocorticoids, with some evidence that topical intranasal glucocorticoids reduce NP size. Although inhaled hypertonic saline (7%) has been widely studied as a mucolytic agent for CF lung disease, there are no reports of its use in CF CRS. Mucolytics have also not been studied as a treatment for CRS in CF, and most evidence does not support their use for CF lung disease. Nasally nebulized dornase alfa (recombinant human deoxyribonuclease) following sinus surgery shows promise for treatment. Other unproven therapies include addition of baby shampoo to isotonic saline to potentially thin mucus and help prevent biofilm formation. There are no data to support the use of low-dose oral macrolide antibiotics or the use of prophylactic oral antibiotics for CRS in patients with CF. However, there is some support for the use of topical antibiotics, including colistimethate sodium or tobramycin, administered as a sinus irrigation or antral lavage in patients following sinus surgery when susceptible bacteria are cultured. Key components of CF sinus surgical management include extensive surgery to ensure that the maxillary, frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid sinuses are all widely opened with smoothing of bony overhangs to prevent mucus retention and bacterial recolonization, postoperative meticulous daily nasal irrigations, and appropriate use of culture-directed topical antibiotics. There are no data yet on whether CF-targeted therapies, including ivacaftor or ivacaftor combined with lumacaftor, have an impact on CF CRS.\n",
      "Identifying subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who may benefit from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-modulating drugs is time-consuming, costly, and especially challenging for individuals with rare uncharacterized CFTR mutations. We studied CFTR function and responses to two drugs-the prototypical CFTR potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor/KALYDECO) and the CFTR corrector VX-809 (lumacaftor)-in organoid cultures derived from the rectal epithelia of subjects with CF, who expressed a broad range of CFTR mutations. We observed that CFTR residual function and responses to drug therapy depended on both the CFTR mutation and the genetic background of the subjects. In vitro drug responses in rectal organoids positively correlated with published outcome data from clinical trials with VX-809 and VX-770, allowing us to predict from preclinical data the potential for CF patients carrying rare CFTR mutations to respond to drug therapy. We demonstrated proof of principle by selecting two subjects expressing an uncharacterized rare CFTR genotype (G1249R/F508del) who showed clinical responses to treatment with ivacaftor and one subject (F508del/R347P) who showed a limited response to drug therapy both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that in vitro measurements of CFTR function in patient-derived rectal organoids may be useful for identifying subjects who would benefit from CFTR-correcting treatment, independent of their CFTR mutation.\n",
      "In CFTR, the chloride channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) opens the pore, and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. Spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR, but in certain CF mutants constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. The molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating are unclear. Here we correlate energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels. We show that spontaneous openings are also strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may therefore occur even without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are therefore intrinsic to CFTR: ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations. This explains correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms.\n",

We hypothesize that insight into this question could be gained by comparing the effect of potentiators on CFTR channels from different origins, e.g., human, mouse, and Xenopus (frog). In the present study, we combined this comparative molecular pharmacology approach with that of computer-aided drug discovery to identify and characterize new potentiators of CFTR and to explore possible mechanism of action. Our results demonstrate that 1) VX-770, NPPB, GlyH-101, P1, P2, and P3 all exhibited ortholog-specific behavior in that they potentiated hCFTR, mCFTR, and xCFTR with different efficacies; 2) P1, P2, and P3 potentiated hCFTR in excised macropatches in a manner dependent on the degree of PKA-mediated stimulation; 3) P1 and P2 did not have additive effects, suggesting that these compounds might share binding sites. Also 4) using a pharmacophore modeling approach, we identified three new potentiators (IOWH-032, OSSK-2, and OSSK-3) that have structures similar to GlyH-101 and that also exhibit ortholog-specific potentiation of CFTR. These could potentially serve as lead compounds for development of new drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The ortholog-specific behavior of these compounds suggest that a comparative pharmacology approach, using cross-ortholog chimeras, may be useful for identification of binding sites on human CFTR.\n",
      "We reviewed the impact of ivacaftor on Scottish paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis ≥6 years of age after 12 months of treatment. Statistically significant improvements in FEV1 and body mass index and a reduction in sweat chloride, all comparable with previously published data were observed. The findings also suggested reduced use of intravenous antibiotics and oral antibiotics. No significant adverse effects were observed but a possible association with cataract formation could not be excluded. This review suggests that, in the short term at least, ivacaftor is effective and safe in paediatric patients ≥6 years of age with G551D.\n",

      "This project aimed to explore the attitudes of prenatal genetic counselors toward discussion of novel approved and experimental CF treatments in the prenatal setting, and to assess how knowledge of genotype-specific, targeted treatments may influence their current practices. Targeted treatments have the potential to impact the health-related quality of life of individuals affected with CF and therefore, knowledge of the availability of such treatments may influence the decision-making process of parents who receive a fetal diagnosis of CF. Using the 2012 FDA approval and introduction of ivacaftor into CF clinical practice as a case study, a survey was designed to explore the opinions and practices of prenatal genetic counselors with regard to counseling for a prenatal diagnosis of CF, and how those practices might be impacted by the availability of a new genotype-specific treatment. Approximately 800 genetic counselors were sent questionnaires in January of 2013. Respondents were provided information about this treatment and were asked to rate its perceived benefits, along with the likelihood that they would discuss potential benefits and limitations with parents receiving a prenatal diagnosis of CF. One-hundred sixty-nine prenatal genetic counselors (21.1 %) responded to the survey. Results indicated that 80 % of respondents 'never heard of the drug', or they were 'not exactly sure' what it was. After reading the materials provided, counselors felt the new treatment would have 'some' or a 'significant' impact on an affected individual's life. Their opinions varied on what information about this treatment they would choose to discuss with their patients; even if the treatment is currently FDA approved and clinically available for affected individuals with the genotype of the fetus. However, they would 'definitely' refer these patients to a specialist to discuss targeted treatments further. Most prenatal genetic counselors indicated there are certain scenarios in the prenatal setting which warrant a discussion of targeted treatments for CF, at least on some level. Counselor's views on sharing information about new treatment options are shaped by their familiarity with the treatment and their perception of its benefits and limitations, their comfort discussing these subjects, and their interpretation of the genetic counselor's role. Most genetic counselors had never heard of ivacaftor or Kalydeco™ prior to taking the survey. Therefore, counselors need to be better educated about the availability of CFTR mutation-based treatments before they will be able to incorporate discussion of new treatment options into their counseling.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening inherited disease caused by the loss or dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel activity resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Phe508del is the most prevalent mutation, with approximately 90% of all CF patients carrying it on at least one allele. Over the past two or three decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of CF, and in the development of effective CF therapies. The approval of Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) marks another milestone in CF therapeutics development, which, with the advent of personalized medicine, could potentially revolutionize CF care and management. This article reviews the rationale, progress and future direction in the development of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination to treat CF patients homozygous for the Phe508del-CFTR mutation.\n",

      "The most common mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene leads to deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 (ΔF508) in the CFTR protein and causes multiple folding and functional defects. Contrary to large-scale efforts by industry and academia, no significant therapeutic benefit has been achieved with a single &quot;corrector&quot;. Therefore, investigations concentrate on drug combinations. Orkambi (Vertex Pharmaceuticals), the first FDA-approved drug for treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by this mutation, is a combination of a corrector (VX-809) that facilitates ΔF508 CFTR biogenesis and a potentiator (VX-770), which improves its function. Yet, clinical trials utilizing this combination showed only modest therapeutic benefit. The low efficacy Orkambi has been attributed to VX-770-mediated destabilization of VX-809-rescued ΔF508 CFTR. Here we report that the negative effects of VX-770 can be reversed by increasing the half-life of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form (band B) of ΔF508 CFTR with another corrector (Corr-4a.) Although Corr-4a alone has only minimal effects on ΔF508 CFTR rescue, it increases the half-life of ΔF508 CFTR band B when it is present during half-life measurements. Our data shows that stabilization of band B ΔF508 CFTR with Corr-4a and simultaneous rescue with VX-809, leads to a &gt;2-fold increase in cAMP-activated, CFTRinh-172-inhibited currents compared to VX-809 alone, or VX-809+VX-770. The negative effects of VX-770 and the Corr-4a protection are specific to the native I507-ATT ΔF508 CFTR without affecting the inherently more stable, synonymous variant I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR. Our studies emphasize that stabilization of ΔF508 CFTR band B in the ER might improve its functional rescue by Orkambi.\n",

      "The most common cystic fibrosis (CF) causing mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508 or Phe508del), results in functional expression defect of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of secretory epithelia, which is attributed to the degradation of the misfolded channel at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Deletion of phenylalanine 670 (ΔF670) in the yeast oligomycin resistance 1 gene (YOR1, an ABC transporter) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenocopies the ΔF508-CFTR folding and trafficking defects. Genome-wide phenotypic (phenomic) analysis of the Yor1-ΔF670 biogenesis identified several modifier genes of mRNA processing and translation, which conferred oligomycin resistance to yeast. Silencing of orthologues of these candidate genes enhanced the ΔF508-CFTR functional expression at the apical PM in human CF bronchial epithelia. Although knockdown of RPL12, a component of the ribosomal stalk, attenuated the translational elongation rate, it increased the folding efficiency as well as the conformational stability of the ΔF508-CFTR, manifesting in 3-fold augmented PM density and function of the mutant. Combination of RPL12 knockdown with the corrector drug, VX-809 (lumacaftor) restored the mutant function to ~50% of the wild-type channel in primary CFTRΔF508/ΔF508 human bronchial epithelia. These results and the observation that silencing of other ribosomal stalk proteins partially rescue the loss-of-function phenotype of ΔF508-CFTR suggest that the ribosomal stalk modulates the folding efficiency of the mutant and is a potential therapeutic target for correction of the ΔF508-CFTR folding defect.\n",
      "The potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor/KALYDECO™) targets defective gating of CFTR and has been approved for treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects carrying G551D, S1251N or one of 8 other mutations. Still, the current potentiator treatment does not normalize CFTR-dependent biomarkers, indicating the need for development of more effective potentiator strategies. We have recently pioneered a functional CFTR assay in primary rectal organoids and used this model to characterize interactions between VX-770, genistein and curcumin, the latter 2 being natural food components with established CFTR potentiation capacities. Results indicated that all possible combinations of VX-770, genistein and curcumin synergistically repaired CFTR-dependent forskolin-induced swelling of organoids with CFTR-S1251N or CFTR-G551D, even under suboptimal CFTR activation and compounds concentrations, conditions that may predominate in vivo. Genistein and curcumin also enhanced forskolin-induced swelling of F508del homozygous organoids that were treated with VX-770 and the prototypical CFTR corrector VX-809. These results indicate that VX-770, genistein and curcumin in double or triple combinations can synergize in restoring CFTR-dependent fluid secretion in primary CF cells and support the use of multiple potentiators for treatment of CF.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease of the Caucasian population worldwide, with respiratory disease remaining the most relevant source of morbidity and mortality. Computed tomography (CT) is frequently used for monitoring disease complications and progression. Over the last fifteen years there has been a six-fold increase in the use of CT, which has lead to a growing concern in relation to cumulative radiation exposure. The challenge to the medical profession is to identify dose reduction strategies that meet acceptable image quality, but fulfil the requirements of a diagnostic quality CT. Dose-optimisation, particularly in CT, is essential as it reduces the chances of patients receiving cumulative radiation doses in excess of 100 mSv, a dose deemed significant by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. This review article explores the current trends in imaging in CF with particular emphasis on new developments in dose optimisation.\n",

      "Evidence supporting the occurrence of oxidative stress in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is well established and the literature suggests that oxidative stress is inseparably linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we have characterized mitochondrial function, in particular as it regards the steps of oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production, in airway cells either homozygous for the F508del-CFTR allele or stably expressing wt-CFTR. We find that oxygen consumption, ΔΨ generation, adenine nucleotide translocator-dependent ADP/ATP exchange and both mitochondrial Complex I and IV activities are impaired in CF cells, while both mitochondrial ROS production and membrane lipid peroxidation increase. Importantly, treatment of CF cells with the small molecules VX-809 and 4,6,4'-trimethylangelicin, which act as &quot;correctors&quot; for F508del CFTR by rescuing the F508del CFTR-dependent chloride secretion, while having no effect per sè on mitochondrial function in wt-CFTR cells, significantly improved all the above mitochondrial parameters towards values found in the airway cells expressing wt-CFTR. This novel study on mitochondrial bioenergetics provides a springboard for future research to further understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the involvement of mitochondria in CF and identify the proteins primarily responsible for the F508del-CFTR-dependent mitochondrial impairment and thus reveal potential novel targets for CF therapy.\n",
      "Ivacaftor, a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with the G551D genetic mutation, lacks long-term clinical and cost projections. This study forecasted outcomes and cost by comparing ivacaftor plus usual care versus usual care alone.A lifetime Markov model was conducted from a US payer perspective. The model consisted of five health states: 1) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) % pred ≥70%, 2) 40%≤ FEV1 % pred &lt;70%, 3) FEV1 % pred &lt;40%, 4) lung transplantation and 5) death. All inputs were extracted from published literature. Budget impact was also estimated. We estimated ivacaftor's improvement in outcomes compared with a non-CF referent population.Ivacaftor was associated with 18.25 (95% credible interval (CrI) 13.71-22.20) additional life-years and 15.03 (95% CrI 11.13-18.73) additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Ivacaftor was associated with improvements in survival and QALYs equivalent to 68% and 56%, respectively, for the survival and QALY gaps between CF usual care and their non-CF peers. The incremental lifetime cost was $3 374 584. The budget impact was $0.087 per member per month.Ivacaftor increased life-years and QALYs in CF patients with the G551D mutation, and moved morbidity and mortality closer to that of their non-CF peers. Ivacaftor costs much more than usual care, but comes at a relatively limited budget impact.\n",
      "Small-molecule therapies that restore defects in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gating (potentiators) or trafficking (correctors) are being developed for cystic fibrosis (CF) in a mutation-specific fashion. Options for pharmacological correction of CFTR-p.Phe508del (F508del) are being extensively studied but correction of other trafficking mutants that may also benefit from corrector treatment remains largely unknown.We studied correction of the folding mutants CFTR-p.Phe508del, -p.Ala455Glu (A455E) and -p.Asn1303Lys (N1303K) by VX-809 and 18 other correctors (C1-C18) using a functional CFTR assay in human intestinal CF organoids.Function of both CFTR-p.Phe508del and -p.Ala455Glu was enhanced by a variety of correctors but no residual or corrector-induced activity was associated with CFTR-p.Asn1303Lys. Importantly, VX-809-induced correction was most dominant for CFTR-p.Phe508del, while correction of CFTR-p.Ala455Glu was highest by a subgroup of compounds called bithiazoles (C4, C13, C14 and C17) and C5.These data support the development of mutation-specific correctors for optimal treatment of different CFTR trafficking mutants, and identify C5 and bithiazoles as the most promising compounds for correction of CFTR-p.Ala455Glu.\n",

Yet, despite the success of this endeavor, many other compounds have been proposed as therapeutic agents in the treatment of CF. Of note, several of these compounds are naturally occurring, and are present in spices from the grocery store and over the counter preparations in health food stores.

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder that affects about 70,000 people worldwide. The clinical manifestations of the disease are caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989 has led to a sophisticated understanding of how thousands of mutations in the CFTR gene affect the structure and function of the CFTR protein. Much progress has been made over the past decade with the development of orally bioavailable small molecule drugs that target defective CFTR proteins caused by specific mutations. Furthermore, there is considerable optimism about the prospect of gene replacement or editing therapies to correct all mutations in cystic fibrosis. The recent approvals of ivacaftor and lumacaftor represent the genesis of a new era of precision medicine in the treatment of this condition. These drugs are having a positive impact on the lives of people with cystic fibrosis and are potentially disease modifying. This review provides an update on advances in our understanding of the structure and function of the CFTR, with a focus on state of the art targeted drugs that are in development.\n",

      "W1282X is a common nonsense mutation among cystic fibrosis patients that results in the production of a truncated Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) channel. Here we show that the channel activity of the W1282X-CFTR polypeptide is exceptionally low in excised membrane patches at normally saturating doses of ATP and PKA (single channel open probability (PO) &lt; 0.01). However, W1282X-CFTR channels were stimulated by two CFTR modulators, the FDA-approved VX-770 and the dietary compound curcumin. Each of these compounds is an allosteric modulator of CFTR gating that promotes channel activity in the absence of the native ligand, ATP. Although W1282X-CFTR channels were stimulated by VX-770 in the absence of ATP their activities remained dependent on PKA phosphorylation. Thus, activated W1282X-CFTR channels should remain under physiologic control by cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways in vivo. VX-770 and curcumin exerted additive effects on W1282X-CFTR channel gating (opening/closing) in excised patches such that the Po of the truncated channel approached unity (&gt; 0.9) when treated with both modulators. VX-770 and curcumin also additively stimulated W1282X-CFTR mediated currents in polarized FRT epithelial monolayers. In this setting, however, the stimulated W1282X-CFTR currents were smaller than those mediated by wild type CFTR (3-5%) due presumably to lower expression levels or cell surface targeting of the truncated protein. Combining allosteric modulators of different mechanistic classes is worth considering as a treatment option for W1282X CF patients perhaps when coupled with maneuvers to increase expression of the truncated protein.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal monogenic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that entails the (diagnostic) increase in sweat electrolyte concentrations, progressive lung disease with chronic inflammation and recurrent bacterial infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and male infertility. Therapies aimed at restoring the CFTR defect have emerged. Thus, a small molecule which facilitates chloride channel opening, the potentiator Ivacaftor, has been approved for the treatment of CF patients bearing a particular class of rare CFTR mutations. However, small molecules that directly target the most common misfolded CFTR mutant, F508del, and improve its intracellular trafficking in vitro, have been less effective than expected when tested in CF patients, even in combination with Ivacaftor. Thus, new strategies are required to circumvent the F508del-CFTR defect. Airway and intestinal epithelial cells from CF patients bearing the F508del-CFTR mutation exhibit an impressive derangement of cellular proteostasis, with oxidative stress, overactivation of the tissue transglutaminase (TG2), and disabled autophagy. Proteostasis regulators such as cysteamine can rescue and stabilize a functional F508del-CFTR protein through suppressing TG2 activation and restoring autophagy in vivo in F508del-CFTR homozygous mice, in vitro in CF patient-derived cell lines, ex vivo in freshly collected primary patient's nasal cells, as well as in a pilot clinical trial involving homozygous F508del-CFTR patients. Here, we discuss how the therapeutic normalization of defective proteostasis can be harnessed for the treatment of CF patients with the F508del-CFTR mutation.\n",

      "Recently approved therapies that modulate CFTR function have shown significant clinical benefit, but recent investigations regarding their molecular mechanism when used in combination have not been consistent with clinical results. We employed micro-optical coherence tomography as a novel means to assess the mechanism of action of CFTR modulators, focusing on the effects on mucociliary clearance. Primary human airway monolayers from patients with a G551D mutation responded to ivacaftor treatment with increased ion transport, airway surface liquid depth, ciliary beat frequency, and mucociliary transport rate, in addition to decreased effective viscosity of the mucus layer, a unique mechanism established by our findings. These endpoints are consistent with the benefit observed in G551D patients treated with ivacaftor, and identify a novel mechanism involving mucus viscosity. In monolayers derived from F508del patients, the situation is more complicated, compounded by disparate effects on CFTR expression and function. However, by combining ion transport measurements with functional imaging, we establish a crucial link between in vitro data and clinical benefit, a finding not explained by ion transport studies alone. We establish that F508del cells exhibit increased mucociliary transport and decreased mucus effective viscosity, but only when ivacaftor is added to the regimen. We further show that improvement in the functional microanatomy in vitro corresponds with lung function benefit observed in the clinical trials, whereas ion transport in vitro corresponds to changes in sweat chloride. Functional imaging reveals insights into clinical efficacy and CFTR biology that significantly impact our understanding of novel therapies.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive condition, is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting children and young adults in Canada. It is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, located on chromosome seven. This gene encodes for a chloride channel that regulates transport of salt and water across cell membranes. When CFTR is dysfunctional, secretions become tenacious and sticky, resulting in pathology in multiple organ systems, most notably the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Although there is no cure for the underlying disease process, current therapies have increased the overall survival of CF patients, with the median life expectancy now at 48 years based on recent Canadian statistics. The goals of CF therapy until now have been: (1) preservation of lung function by minimizing pulmonary infection and inflammation; (2) restoration of baseline pulmonary function, symptoms, and level of inflammation following acute respiratory exacerbations; and (3) maintenance of adequate nutrition. Therapeutic strategy consists of a combination of physiotherapy, pharmacologic drugs (i.e., antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, mucolytic drugs), nutritional treatments (i.e., high-calorie and high-fat diets) and pancreatic enzyme replacement for those with pancreatic insufficiency. To date, no therapies have addressed the underlying genetic defect or corrected the abnormal functioning of CFTR. Ivacaftor is a first-in-class oral CFTR potentiator approved by Health Canada for the treatment of CF in patients aged six years and older who have G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R, or G970R mutation in the CFTR gene. The drug works by prolonging the time that activated CFTR channels remain open, thereby enhancing the regulation of chloride and water transport across cell membranes. It is available as a 150 mg oral tablet. The Health Canada recommended dose is 150 mg every 12 hours with fat-containing food. The manufacturer is seeking a listing recommendation based on the Health Canada indication. Accordingly, a systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of ivacaftor 150 mg for the treatment of CF in patients age six years and older who have a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R, or G970R mutation in the CFTR gene.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease affecting approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide. Until recently, drug development efforts have emphasised therapies treating downstream signs and symptoms resulting from the underlying CF biological defect: reduced function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The current CF drug development landscape has expanded to include therapies that enhance CFTR function by either restoring wild-type CFTR protein expression or increasing (modulating) the function of mutant CFTR proteins in cells. To date, two systemic small-molecule CFTR modulators have been evaluated in pivotal clinical trials in individuals with CF and specific mutant CFTR genotypes that have led to regulatory review and/or approval. Advances in the discovery of CFTR modulators as a promising new class of therapies have been impressive, yet work remains to develop highly effective, disease-modifying modulators for individuals of all CF genotypes. The objectives of this review are to outline the challenges and opportunities in drug development created by systemic genotype-specific CFTR modulators, highlight the advantages of sweat chloride as an established biomarker of CFTR activity to streamline early-phase development and summarise options for later phase clinical trial designs that respond to the adoption of approved genotype-specific modulators into standard of care.

      "Personalized medicine promises that medical decisions, practices and products are tailored to the individual patient. Cystic fibrosis, an inherited disorder of chloride and bicarbonate transport in exocrine glands, is the first successful example of customized drug development for mutation-specific therapy. There are two classes of CFTR modulators: potentiators that increase the activity of CFTR at the cell surface, and correctors that either promote the read-through of nonsense mutations or facilitate the translation, folding, maturation and trafficking of mutant CFTR to the cell surface. The potentiator ivacaftor and the corrector lumacaftor are approved in Germany for the treatment of people with cystic fibrosis who carry a gating mutation such as p.Gly551Asp or who are homozygous for the most common mutation p.Phe508del, respectively. This report provides an overview of the basic defect in cystic fibrosis, the population genetics of CFTR mutations in Germany and the bioassays to assess CFTR function in humans together with the major achievements of preclinical research and clinical trials to bring CFTR modulators to the clinic. Some practical information on the use of ivacaftor and lumacaftor in daily practice and an update on pitfalls, challenges and novel strategies of bench-to-bedside development of CFTR modulators are also provided.\n",

      "The most common mutation of CFTR, affecting approximately 90% of CF patients, is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del, ΔF508). Misfolding of ΔF508-CFTR impairs both its trafficking to the plasma membrane and its chloride channel activity. To identify small molecules that can restore channel activity of ΔF508-CFTR, we synthesized and evaluated eighteen novel hydroxypyrazoline analogues as CFTR potentiators. To elucidate potentiation activities of hydroxypyrazolines for ΔF508-CFTR, CFTR activity was measured using a halide-sensitive YFP assay, Ussing chamber assay and patch-clamp technique. Compounds 7p, 7q and 7r exhibited excellent potentiation with EC50 value &lt;10 μM. Among the compounds, 7q (a novel CFTR potentiator, CP7q) showed the highest potentiation activity with EC50 values of 0.88 ± 0.11 and 4.45 ± 0.31 μM for wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR, respectively. In addition, CP7q significantly potentiated chloride conductance of G551D-CFTR, a CFTR gating mutant; its maximal potentiation activity was 1.9 fold higher than the well-known CFTR potentiator genistein. Combination treatment with CP7q and VX-809, a corrector of ΔF508-CFTR, significantly enhanced functional rescue of ΔF508-CFTR compared with VX-809 alone. CP7q did not alter the cytosolic cAMP level and showed no cytotoxicity at the concentration showing maximum efficacy. The hydroxypyrazolines may be potential development candidates for drug therapy of cystic fibrosis.\n",

      "The most common mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, F508del, produces a misfolded protein resulting in its defective trafficking to the cell surface and an impaired chloride secretion. Pharmacological treatments partially rescue F508del CFTR activity either directly by interacting with the mutant protein and/or indirectly by altering the cellular protein homeostasis. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of ezrin together with its binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) tethers the F508del CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton, stabilizing it on the apical membrane and rescuing the sub-membrane compartmentalization of cAMP and activated PKA. Both the small molecules trimethylangelicin (TMA) and VX-809, which act as 'correctors' for F508del CFTR by rescuing F508del-CFTR-dependent chloride secretion, also restore the apical expression of phosphorylated ezrin and actin organization and increase cAMP and activated PKA submembrane compartmentalization in both primary and secondary cystic fibrosis airway cells. Latrunculin B treatment or expression of the inactive ezrin mutant T567A reverse the TMA and VX-809-induced effects highlighting the role of corrector-dependent ezrin activation and actin re-organization in creating the conditions to generate a sub-cortical cAMP pool of adequate amplitude to activate the F508del-CFTR-dependent chloride secretion.\n",
      "More than 2000 mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) have been described that confer a range of molecular cell biological and functional phenotypes. Most of these mutations lead to compromised anion conductance at the apical plasma membrane of secretory epithelia and cause cystic fibrosis (CF) with variable disease severity. Based on the molecular phenotypic complexity of CFTR mutants and their susceptibility to pharmacotherapy, it has been recognized that mutations may impose combinatorial defects in CFTR channel biology. This notion led to the conclusion that the combination of pharmacotherapies addressing single defects (e.g., transcription, translation, folding, and/or gating) may show improved clinical benefit over available low-efficacy monotherapies. Indeed, recent phase 3 clinical trials combining ivacaftor (a gating potentiator) and lumacaftor (a folding corrector) have proven efficacious in CF patients harboring the most common mutation (deletion of residue F508, ΔF508, or Phe508del). This drug combination was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for patients homozygous for ΔF508. Emerging studies of the structural, cell biological, and functional defects caused by rare mutations provide a new framework that reveals a mixture of deficiencies in different CFTR alleles. Establishment of a set of combinatorial categories of the previously defined basic defects in CF alleles will aid the design of even more efficacious therapeutic interventions for CF patients.\n",

      "In cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic respiratory infections result in an exaggerated and uncontrolled inflammatory response that ultimately lead to a decrease in pulmonary function. We have previously described the presence of the alarmin IL-33 in lung explants from CF patients. The signals regulating IL-33 expression in the airway epithelium following a gram-negative bacterial infection are currently unknown. Our objective was to characterize the pathways in CF airway epithelial cells (AECs) leading to an increase in IL-33 expression. We found that, in CF AECs expressing a deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 of the gene coding for Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTRdelF508), exposure to live Pseudomonas aeruginosa upregulates IL-33 via the TLR2 and TLR5 signaling pathways. This up-regulation can be partially or fully reverted by pre-incubating CFTRdelF508 AECs with a CFTR corrector (VX-809) and/or a CFTR potentiator (VX-770). Similarly, incubation with the CFTR corrector and/or the CFTR potentiator also decreased IL-8 expression in response to infection. Moreover, using different protein kinase inhibitors that target elements downstream of TLR signaling, we show that the TAK1→IKKβ→TPL2→MKK1/MKK2 pathway regulates IL-33 expression following an infection with P. aeruginosa. Our findings represent the first characterization of the signals regulating IL-33 expression in CF airway epithelial cells in response to a bacterial infection.\n",
      "Current cystic fibrosis treatment is symptomatic and has greatly increased life expectancy over the last decades. However, mean age of death is still 29-years-old. Innovative therapeutic molecules aiming at restoring CFTR function are developed. Ivacaftor is the first medicine approved in 2012 for the 3% of patients worldwide carrying the rare CFTR mutation called G5510. Ivacafter is associated with a sustained improvement in respiratory function and a decreased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. Other pharmacotherapies are being developed that aim at correcting other CFTR defects due to other CFTR mutations, especially the most frequent F508del mutation.\n",

The treatment regimen also includes bronchodilators for bronchospasms and azithromycin. Regular physical activity is recommended. A treatment potentiating the CFTR protein, ivacaftor, is now indicated for patients with a class 3 mutation. Initial bronchial infection with PA must be treated as soon as possible in order to eradicate the pathogen. Pulmonary exacerbations require antibiotic courses, either orally or intravenously for PA infection. Complications require hospitalisation, with thoracic chest tube placement for a pneumothorax or bronchial artery embolisation for massive hemoptysis. Oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation with a nasal mask become necessary when respiratory insufficiency progresses, justifying the initiation of the lung transplant process. Lung disease affects the prognosis of cystic fibrosis, therefore its management in cystic fibrosis centres is of utmost importance. Maintenance treatment mainly relies on daily chest physiotherapy, which can be facilitated by mucolytic\n",
      "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease predominantly affecting the airways and predisposing patients to recurrent infections with various multidrug resistant organisms. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection is rarely seen, but considered a potential pathogen in CF patients. We report a 26 year old pregnant CF patient on Ivacaftor who was admitted with symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis. Three years prior to the current admission, she had completed four drug anti- MTB therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis and was considered cured as her sputum cultures after six months of treatment were negative. Genotype analysis revealed the current MTB strain to be different from the strain causing the previous infection. After receiving first line anti-tuberculous regimen for nine months, the patient's condition markedly improved culminating in an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. To our knowledge, this is the only reported case of reinfection tuberculosis in a CF patient.\n",

      "The phenylhydrazone RDR-1 is endowed with moderate activity as F508del-CFTR corrector; nevertheless, its simple structure enables stimulating developments in this class of correctors. Therefore, we synthesized a number of phenylhydrazones 3 by reacting phenylhydrazine derivatives 1 with furfural derivatives 2. By the same reaction, also the pyridine derivatives 4, the thiophene derivatives 5, and the hydrazides 6 and 7 were prepared. All compounds were tested as F508del-CFTR correctors in the cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o-, using corr-4a and VX-809 as controls. Some of the tested compounds emerged as interesting F508del-CFTR correctors at 20 μM (3c) and 2 μM (5d). 3c and 5d administered together with VX-809 produced a satisfactory additivity of action. When the structure of 5d was overlapped with RDR-1 and five other established correctors, a shared central design was clearly visible. This fact may be of interest in the search for new F508del-CFTR correctors.\n",

      "In the late 1980s, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel was identified to be the primary cause of cystic fibrosis (CF); a fatal multiple-organ disorder that mostly affects Caucasians. To date, approximately 2000 genetic mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/app). The most common cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with CF is a progressive deterioration in lung function leading ultimately to respiratory collapse. The median life expectancy of CF patients currently is estimated to be 39 years in the US. The most prevalent CFTR mutation, F508del, accounts for 70% of CF cases and causes a processing defect in the protein leading to premature endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and reduced F508del-CFTR delivery to the cell surface. A CF corrector is defined as a chemical chaperone that increases cell-surface levels of F508del-CFTR. A series of CF correctors have been developed, and VX-809 (lumacaftor) has been cited as the most effective symptomatic CF corrector to date. VX-809 improves the function of the mutant protein by approximately 15% in in vitro culture systems. However, this effect did not completely translate clinically, with only a marginal improvement observed in lung function of the F508del-homozygous patients undergoing the therapy. New studies revealed that even after successful ER retrieval, rescued F508del-CFTR (rF508del-CFTR) once at the cell surface does not function properly, exhibiting poor stability and channel gating and structural abnormalities. This becomes further complicated by the existence of genes termed CFTR modifiers, which can alter CFTR function to be additionally defective and exacerbate the CF phenotype while also alternatively suggested be potentially targeted to improve F508del-CFTR functional outcome. It is necessary to understand the biology of F508del-CFTR post-ER and at the plasma membrane where the protein might also confront the modifiers and how we can incorporate these components into CF therapeutics. Additionally, the notion that CF individuals would eventually benefit from more of a personalized medicine is becoming increasingly accepted. Here, we review how CF therapeutics may be simplified by understanding the complexities of rescued F508del-CFTR biology and eventually move toward more personalized medicine for patients suffering with CF.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), leading to significant morbidity and mortality. CFTR is a chloride and bicarbonate channel at the epithelial cell membrane. The most common CFTR mutation is F508del, resulting in minimal CFTR at the plasma membrane. Current disease management is supportive, whereas an ultimate goal is to develop therapies to restore CFTR activity. We summarize experience with lumacaftor, a small molecule that increases F508del-CFTR levels at the plasma membrane. Lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, a modulator of CFTR gating defects, improves clinical outcome measures in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation. Lumacaftor represents a significant advancement in the treatment of biochemical abnormalities in CF. Further development of CFTR modulators will improve upon current therapies, although it remains unclear whether this approach will provide therapies for all CFTR mutations.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, is a life-limiting disease characterized by chronic bacterial airway infection and severe inflammation. Some CFTR mutants have reduced responsiveness to cAMP/PKA signaling; hence, pharmacological agents that elevate intracellular cAMP are potentially useful for the treatment of CF. By inhibiting cAMP breakdown, phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors stimulate CFTR in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that PDE inhibition by RPL554, a drug that has been shown to cause bronchodilation in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, stimulates CFTR-dependent ion secretion across bronchial epithelial cells isolated from patients carrying the R117H/F508del CF genotype. RPL554-induced CFTR activity was further increased by the potentiator VX-770, suggesting an additional benefit by the drug combination. RPL554 also increased cilia beat frequency in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. The results indicate RPL554 may increase mucociliary clearance through stimulation of CFTR and increasing ciliary beat frequency and thus could provide a novel therapeutic option for CF.\n",

      "The mechanism underlying pulmonary inflammation in thermal inhalation injury remains elusive. Cystic fibrosis, also hallmarked with pulmonary inflammation, is caused by mutations in CFTR, the expression of which is temperature-sensitive. We investigated whether CFTR is involved in heat-induced pulmonary inflammation. We applied heat-treatment in 16HBE14o- cells with CFTR knockdown or overexpression and heat-inhalation in rats in vivo. Heat-treatment caused significant reduction in CFTR and, reciprocally, increase in COX-2 at early stages both in vitro and in vivo. Activation of ERK/JNK, NF-κB and COX-2/PGE2 were detected in heat-treated cells, which were mimicked by knockdown, and reversed by overexpression of CFTR or VX-809, a reported CFTR mutation corrector. JNK/ERK inhibition reversed heat-/CFTR-knockdown-induced NF-κB activation, whereas NF-κB inhibitor showed no effect on JNK/ERK. IL-8 was augmented by heat-treatment or CFTR-knockdown, which was abolished by inhibition of NF-κB, JNK/ERK or COX-2. Moreover, in vitro or in vivo treatment with curcumin, a natural phenolic compound, significantly enhanced CFTR expression and reversed the heat-induced increases in COX-2/PGE2/IL-8, neutrophil infiltration and tissue damage in the airway. These results have revealed a CFTR-regulated MAPK/NF-κB pathway leading to COX-2/PGE2/IL-8 activation in thermal inhalation injury, and demonstrated therapeutic potential of curcumin for alleviating heat-induced pulmonary inflammation.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes multiorgan morbidity and premature death, most commonly from pulmonary dysfunction. Mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, of which almost 2000 have been described, result in a dysfunctional CFTR protein. This protein is an adenosine triphosphate binding anion channel, present primarily at the surface of epithelial cells. Loss of function mutations in this anion channel result in decreased or absent chloride/bicarbonate transport. The subsequent abnormal salt and water transport at epithelial cell surfaces leads to thickened secretions, and infection or inflammation in affected organs. In the last 20 years, therapeutics have been developed to treat the signs and symptoms of CF. However, in 2012, the small molecule drug, ivacaftor, became the first approved therapy that addresses the basic defect in CF. Ivacaftor is a potentiator of CFTR channels defective in their chloride/bicarbonate gating/conductance, but present at the epithelial cell surface. It is only approved for 10 mutations carried by approximately 7% of the population of patients with CF. F508del is the most common CFTR mutation, present in homozygosity in approximately 50% of patients with CF. The F508del mutation results in multiple CFTR channel defects that require both correction (stabilization of misfolded CFTR and trafficking to the epithelial cell membrane) and potentiation. This article reviews the in vitro and clinical trial data for the potential use of the potentiator, ivacaftor, and the corrector, lumacaftor, in patients with CF.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis is primarily considered a respiratory disease with superadded pancreatic dysfunction; however the underlying genetic mutation results in the abnormal function of cells throughout the body - including tissues involved in reproduction. Practically all males and up to 50% of females with CF will suffer fertility issues - the causes of which are multifactorial and could be improved by treatments that target the underlying physiological deficit, such as ivacaftor. We consider the mechanisms by which the rapidly developing field of systemic treatments for CF could impact on the fertility of this group and review the available real world evidence.\n",
      "The most prevalent form of cystic fibrosis arises from an amino acid deletion in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CFTR.

      "Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetically determined, life-limiting disorder in populations of European ancestry. The genetic basis of cystic fibrosis is well established to be mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that codes for an apical membrane chloride channel principally expressed by epithelial cells. Conventional approaches to cystic fibrosis care involve a heavy daily burden of supportive treatments to combat lung infection, help clear airway secretions and maintain nutritional status. In 2012, a new era of precision medicine in cystic fibrosis therapeutics began with the licensing of a small molecule, ivacaftor, which successfully targets the underlying defect and improves CFTR function in a subgroup of patients in a genotype-specific manner. Here, we review the three main targeted approaches that have been adopted to improve CFTR function: potentiators, which recover the function of CFTR at the apical surface of epithelial cells that is disrupted in class III and IV genetic mutations; correctors, which improve intracellular processing of CFTR, increasing surface expression, in class II mutations; and production correctors or read-through agents, which promote transcription of CFTR in class I mutations. The further development of such approaches offers great promise for future therapeutic strategies in cystic fibrosis.\n",

      "There are nearly 2000 mutations in the CFTR gene associated with cystic fibrosis disease, and to date, the only approved drug, Kalydeco, has been effective in rescuing the functional expression of a small subset of these mutant proteins with defects in channel activation. However, there is currently an urgent need to assess other mutations for possible rescue by Kalydeco, and further, definition of the binding site of such modulators on CFTR would enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action of such therapeutics. Here, we describe a simple and rapid one-step PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method to generate mutations in the CFTR gene. This method was used to generate CFTR mutants bearing deletions (p.Gln2_Trp846del, p.Ser700_Asp835del, p.Ile1234_Arg1239del) and truncation with polyhistidine tag insertion (p.Glu1172-3Gly-6-His*), which either recapitulate a disease phenotype or render tools for modulator binding site identification, with subsequent evaluation of drug responses using a high-throughput (384-well) membrane potential-sensitive fluorescence assay of CFTR channel activity within a 1 wk time frame. This proof-of-concept study shows that these methods enable rapid and quantitative comparison of multiple CFTR mutants to emerging drugs, facilitating future large-scale efforts to stratify mutants according to their &quot;theratype&quot; or most promising targeted therapy.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease among Caucasians. It is caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an apical membrane anion channel that is required for regulating the volume and composition of epithelial secretions. The most common CFTR mutation, present on at least one allele in &gt;90% of CF patients, deletes phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del), which causes the protein to misfold. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control elicits the degradation of mutant CFTR, compromising its trafficking to the epithelial cell apical membrane. The absence of functional CFTR leads to depletion of airway surface liquid, impaired clearance of mucus and bacteria from the lung, and predisposes to recurrent infections. Ultimately, respiratory failure results from inflammation and bronchiectasis. Although high throughput screening has identified small molecules that can restore the anion transport function of F508del CFTR, they correct less than 15% of WT CFTR activity, yielding insufficient clinical benefit. To date, most primary CF drug discovery assays have employed measurements of CFTR's anion transport function, a method that depends on the recruitment of a functional CFTR to the cell surface, involves multiple wash steps, and relies on a signal that saturates rapidly. Screening efforts have also included assays for detection of extracellularly HA-tagged or HRP-tagged CFTR, which require multiple washing steps. We have recently developed tools and cell lines that report the correction of mutant CFTR trafficking by currently available small molecules, and have extended this assay to the 96-well format. This new and simple no-wash assay of F508del CFTR at the cell surface may permit the discovery of more efficacious drugs, and hopefully thereby prevent the catastrophic effects of this disease. In addition, the modular design of this platform should make it useful for other diseases where loss-of-function results from folding and/or trafficking defects in membrane proteins.\n",
      "Synonymous mutations, such as I507-ATC→ATT, in deletion of Phe508 in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ΔF508 CFTR), the most frequent disease-associated mutant of CFTR, may affect protein biogenesis, structure, and function and contribute to an altered disease phenotype. Small-molecule drugs are being developed to correct ΔF508 CFTR. To understand correction mechanisms and the consequences of synonymous mutations, we analyzed the effect of mechanistically distinct correctors, corrector 4a (C4) and lumacaftor (VX-809), on I507-ATT and I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR biogenesis and function. C4 stabilized I507-ATT ΔF508 CFTR band B, but without considerable biochemical and functional correction. VX-809 biochemically corrected ∼10% of both of the variants, leading to stable, forskolin+3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)-activated whole-cell currents in the presence of the corrector. Omitting VX-809 during whole-cell recordings led to a spontaneous decline of the currents, suggesting posttranslational stabilization by VX-809. Treatment of cells with the C4+VX-809 combination resulted in enhanced rescue and 2-fold higher forskolin+IBMX-activated currents of both I507-ATT and I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR, compared with VX-809 treatment alone. The lack of an effect of C4 on I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR, but its additive effect in combination with VX-809, implies that C4 acted on VX-809-modified I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR. Our results suggest that binding of C4 and VX-809 to ΔF508 CFTR is conformation specific and provide evidence that synonymous mutations can alter the drug sensitivity of proteins.\n",
      "While a major target in cystic fibrosis (CF) research in recent years has been the development of corrector and potentiator drugs targeting the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, these therapies have not yet proven robust enough to replace or eliminate other therapies that have demonstrated improved health outcomes and quality of life in patients with CF. Further, ivacaftor is only indicated for approximately 5% of the US CF population, although the FDA has recently approved lumacaftor/ivacaftor, a combination therapy intended for those homozygous for Phe508del, which should reach a much larger number of patients.

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) conductance transmembrane regulator functions as a chloride (Cl-) channel in multiple organs, including the lungs. More than 1,800 disease-associated mutations have been identified, which can be divided into six classes. In patients with CF due to class III gating mutations, ivacaftor produces significant improvement in lung function, weight, reduction in sweat chloride level, and pulmonary exacerbations by enhancing the probability of chloride channel opening (gating). Although the benefit of ivacaftor in CF due to gating mutations is established, its potential role in patients with CF due to class IV conductance mutations is emerging. We report 6 months' prospective stability of lung function, improved BMI, reduced pulmonary exacerbations, and reduction in sweat chloride level in a patient with severe CF and the class IV R117H mutation. High-resolution CT scan also improved, thus highlighting the potential usefulness of ivacaftor in patients with severe CF due to class IV mutations.\n",

Several innovative drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, termed genetic modulators, target the underlying disease by modulating the CFTR defect. This review provides physicians with an established simple classification scheme to guide their use of these drugs. The treatment challenge of 1900 CFTR mutations has been simplified into 6 physiologic classes, each paired with an available therapy to offer patients the most functional improvement. Drug therapy monitoring, adverse effects, and indications for discontinuation must also be considered.\n",

      "Combination drug therapies under development for cystic fibrosis caused by the ∆F508 mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) include a &quot;corrector&quot; to improve its cellular processing and a &quot;potentiator&quot; to improve its chloride channel function. Recently, it was reported that the approved potentiator N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide (Ivacaftor) reduces ∆F508-CFTR cellular stability and the efficacy of investigational correctors, including 3-(6-[([1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl) amino]-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-benzoic acid and 1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-[(2R)-2,3-dihydroxypropyl]-6-fluoro-2-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-indol-5-yl), which might contribute to the modest reported efficacy of combination therapy in clinical trials. Here, we report the identification and characterization of potentiators that do not interfere with ∆F508-CFTR stability or corrector action. High-throughput screening and structure-activity analysis identified several classes of potentiators that do not impair corrector action, including tetrahydrobenzothiophenes, thiooxoaminothiazoles, and pyrazole-pyrrole-isoxazoles. The most potent compounds have an EC(50) for ∆F508-CFTR potentiation down to 18 nM and do not reduce corrector efficacy in heterologous ∆F508-CFTR-expressing cells or primary cultures of ∆F508/∆F508 human bronchial epithelia. The ΔF508-CFTR potentiators also activated wild-type and G551D CFTR, albeit weakly. The efficacy of combination therapy for cystic fibrosis caused by the ∆F508 mutation may be improved by replacement of Ivacaftor with a potentiator that does not interfere with corrector action.\n",

In this study, we sought to answer a fundamental question underlying the mechanism of VX-809: does it bind CFTR directly in order to exert its action? We synthesized two VX-809 derivatives, ALK-809 and SUL-809, that possess an alkyne group and retain the rescue capacity of VX-809. By using Cu(I) -catalyzed click chemistry, we provide evidence that the VX-809 derivatives bind CFTR directly in vitro and in cells.

      "Development of therapeutic molecules with clinical efficacy as modulators of defective CFTR includes efforts to identify potentiators that can overcome or repair the gating defect in mutant CFTR channels. This has taken a great leap forward with the identification of the potentiator VX-770, now available to patients as &quot;Kalydeco.&quot; Other small molecules with different chemical structure also are capable of potentiating the activity of either wild-type or mutant CFTR, suggesting that there are features of the protein that may be targeted to achieve stimulation of channel activity by structurally diverse compounds. However, neither the mechanisms by which these compounds potentiate mutant CFTR nor the site(s) where these compounds bind have been identified. This knowledge gap partly reflects the lack of appropriate experimental models to provide clues toward the identification of binding sites. Here, we have compared the channel behavior and response to novel and known potentiators of human CFTR (hCFTR) and murine (mCFTR) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both hCFTR and mCFTR were blocked by GlyH-101 from the extracellular side, but mCFTR activity was increased with GlyH-101 applied directly to the cytoplasmic side. Similarly, glibenclamide only exhibited a blocking effect on hCFTR but both blocked and potentiated mCFTR in excised membrane patches and in intact oocytes. The clinically used CFTR potentiator VX-770 transiently increased hCFTR by ∼13% but potentiated mCFTR significantly more strongly. Our results suggest that mCFTR pharmacological sensitivities differ from hCFTR, which will provide a useful tool for identifying the binding sites and mechanism for these potentiators.\n",

F508del-CFTR mistrafficking may be corrected by acting directly on mutant CFTR itself or by modulating expression/activity of CFTR-interacting proteins, that may thus represent potential drug targets. To evaluate possible candidates for F508del-CFTR rescue, we screened a siRNA library targeting known CFTR interactors. Our analysis identified RNF5 as a protein whose inhibition promoted significant F508del-CFTR rescue and displayed an additive effect with the investigational drug VX-809. Significantly, RNF5 loss in F508del-CFTR transgenic animals ameliorated intestinal malabsorption and concomitantly led to an increase in CFTR activity in intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, we found that RNF5 is differentially expressed in human bronchial epithelia from CF vs. control patients. Our results identify RNF5 as a target for therapeutic modalities to antagonize mutant CFTR proteins.\n",

The most common mutation, F508del, leads to CFTR impaired plasma membrane trafficking. Therapies modulating CFTR basic defect are emerging, such as VX-809, a corrector of F508del-CFTR traffic which just succeeded in a Phase III clinical trial. We recently showed that VX-809 is additive to two other correctors (VRT-325 and compound 4a). Here, we aimed to determine whether the differential rescuing by these compounds results from cell-specific factors or rather from distinct effects at the early biogenesis and/or processing. The rescuing efficiencies of the above three correctors were first compared in different cellular models (primary respiratory cells, cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial and baby hamster kidney [BHK] cell lines) by functional approaches: micro-Ussing chamber and iodide efflux. Next, biochemical methods (metabolic labeling, pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation) were used to determine their impact on CFTR biogenesis / processing. Functional analyses revealed that VX-809 has the greatest rescuing efficacy and that the relative efficiencies of the three compounds are essentially maintained in all three cellular models tested. Nevertheless, biochemical data show that VX-809 significantly stabilizes F508del-CFTR immature form, an effect that is not observed for C3 nor C4. VX-809 and C3 also significantly increase accumulation of immature CFTR. Our data suggest that VX-809 increases the stability of F508del-CFTR immature form at an early phase of its biogenesis, thus explaining its increased efficacy when inducing its rescue.\n",

The recent introduction of the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor into the therapy of a subgroup of patients with specific CFTR mutations was a major milestone and enormous stimulus for seeking effective ion transport modulators for all patients with CF. In this review, we discuss recent breakthroughs and setbacks with CFTR modulators designed to rescue mutant CFTR including the common mutation F508del. Further, we examine the alternative chloride channels TMEM16A and SLC26A9, as well as the epithelial sodium channel ENaC as alternative targets in CF lung disease, which remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Finally, we will focus on the hurdles that still need to be overcome to make effective ion transport modulation therapies available for all patients with CF irrespective of their CFTR genotype.\n",
      "Cystic Fibrosis is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene resulting in abnormal protein function. Recent advances of targeted molecular therapies and high throughput screening have resulted in multiple drug therapies that target many important mutations in the CFTR protein. In this review, we provide the latest results and current progress of CFTR modulators for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, focusing on potentiators of CFTR channel gating and Phe508del processing correctors for the Phe508del CFTR mutation. Special emphasis is placed on the molecular basis underlying these new therapies and emerging results from the latest clinical trials. The future directions for augmenting the rescue of Phe508del with CFTR modulators are also emphasized.\n",
      "Stargardt disease is the most common form of early onset macular degeneration. Mutations in ABCA4, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, are associated with Stargardt disease. Here, we have examined two disease-causing mutations in the NBD1 region of ABCA4, R1108C, and R1129C, which occur within regions of high similarity with CFTR, another ABC transporter gene, which is associated with cystic fibrosis. We show that R1108C and R1129C are both temperature-sensitive processing mutants that engage the cellular quality control mechanism and show a strong interaction with the chaperone Hsp 27. Both mutant proteins also interact with HDCAC6 and are degraded in the aggresome. We also demonstrate that novel corrector compounds that are being tested as treatment for cystic fibrosis, such as VX-809, can rescue the processing of the ABCA4 mutants, particularly their expression at the cell surface, and can reduce their binding to HDAC6. Thus, our data suggest that VX-809 can potentially be developed as a new therapy for Stargardt disease, for which there is currently no treatment.\n",
      "Recently, a significant number of additional key medications have become licensed in Europe for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), including a number of inhaled antibiotics, such as nebulised aztreonam and dry powder versions of colistin and tobramycin for inhalation; dry powder inhaled mannitol, an agent to improve airway hydration and aid airway clearance; and ivacaftor, an oral therapy that directly acts on dysfunctional CFTR to correct the basic defect encountered in CF patients with the G551D CF gene mutation. The marked success of ivacaftor both in clinical trials and in post-licensing evaluation studies in treating patients with G551D and other gating mutations has greatly encouraged the ongoing development of similar therapies that can directly target the underlying cause of CF. Other therapies, including a number of anti-infectives, anti-inflammatories and replacement pancreatic enzymes, are currently undergoing clinical studies. This article reviews those treatments that have been recently licensed for CF and highlights some of the exciting emerging therapies presently under evaluation in clinical trials. In addition, it discusses some of the potential challenges being encountered by research and clinical teams in developing and delivering treatments for this condition.\n",

      "The cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel present in the membrane of epithelial cells. Mutations affecting the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), a multi-organ severe disease. The most common CF mutation, F508del, impairs the processing and activity (gating) of CFTR protein. Other mutations, like G551D, only cause a gating defect. Processing and gating defects can be targeted by small molecules called generically correctors and potentiators, respectively. Aminoarylthiazoles (AATs) represent an interesting class of compounds that includes molecules with dual activity, as correctors and potentiators. With the aim to improve the activity profile of AATs, we have now designed and synthesized a library of novel compounds in order to establish an initial SAR that may provide indications about the chemical groups that are beneficial or detrimental for rescue activity. The new compounds were tested as correctors and potentiators in CFBE41o-expressing F508del-CFTR using a functional assay. A dual active compound, AAT-4a, characterized by improved efficacy and marked synergy when combined with the corrector VX-809 has been identified. Moreover, by computational methods, a possible binding site for AATs in nucleotide binding domain NBD1 has been detected. These results will direct the synthesis of new analogues with possibly improved activity.\n",

      "The peripheral protein quality control (PPQC) checkpoint removes improperly folded proteins from the plasma membrane through a mechanism involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein). PPQC limits the efficacy of some cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs, such as VX-809, that improve trafficking to the plasma membrane of misfolded mutants of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), including F508del-CFTR, which retains partial functionality. We investigated the PPQC checkpoint in lung epithelial cells with F508del-CFTR that were exposed to VX-809. The conformation of the scaffold protein NHERF1 (Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory factor 1) determined whether the PPQC recognized &quot;rescued&quot; F508del-CFTR (the portion that reached the cell surface in VX-809-treated cells). Activation of the cytoskeletal regulator Rac1 promoted an interaction between the actin-binding adaptor protein ezrin and NHERF1, triggering exposure of the second PDZ domain of NHERF1, which interacted with rescued F508del-CFTR. Because binding of F508del-CFTR to the second PDZ of NHERF1 precluded the recruitment of CHIP, the coexposure of airway cells to Rac1 activator nearly tripled the efficacy of VX-809. Interference with the NHERF1-ezrin interaction prevented the increase of efficacy of VX-809 by Rac1 activation, but the actin-binding domain of ezrin was not required for the increase in efficacy. Thus, rather than mainly directing anchoring of F508del-CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton, induction of ezrin activation by Rac1 signaling triggered a conformational change in NHERF1, which was then able to bind and stabilize misfolded CFTR at the plasma membrane. These insights into the cell surface stabilization of CFTR provide new targets to improve treatment of CF.\n",

      "The ΔF508 mutant form of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ΔF508 CFTR) that is normally degraded by the ER-associated degradative pathway can be rescued to the cell surface through low-temperature (27°C) culture or small molecular corrector treatment. However, it is unstable on the cell surface, and rapidly internalized and targeted to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. To understand the mechanism of this rapid turnover, we examined the role of two adaptor complexes (AP-2 and Dab2) and three E3 ubiquitin ligases (c-Cbl, CHIP, and Nedd4-2) on low-temperature rescued ΔF508 CFTR endocytosis and degradation in human airway epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that siRNA depletion of either AP-2 or Dab2 inhibits ΔF508 CFTR endocytosis by 69% and 83%, respectively. AP-2 or Dab2 depletion also increases the rescued protein half-life of ΔF508 CFTR by ~18% and ~91%, respectively. In contrast, the depletion of each of the E3 ligases had no effect on ΔF508 CFTR endocytosis, whereas CHIP depletion significantly increased the surface half-life of ΔF508 CFTR. To determine where and when the ubiquitination occurs during ΔF508 CFTR turnover, we monitored the ubiquitination of rescued ΔF508 CFTR during the time course of CFTR endocytosis. Our results indicate that ubiquitination of the surface pool of ΔF508 CFTR begins to increase 15 min after internalization, suggesting that CFTR is ubiquitinated in a post-endocytic compartment. This post-endocytic ubiquination of ΔF508 CFTR could be blocked by either inhibiting endocytosis, by siRNA knockdown of CHIP, or by treating cells with the CFTR corrector, VX-809. Our results indicate that the post-endocytic ubiquitination of CFTR by CHIP is a critical step in the peripheral quality control of cell surface ΔF508 CFTR.\n",

      "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). ΔF508-CFTR, the most common disease-causing CF mutant, exhibits folding and trafficking defects and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is targeted for proteasomal degradation. To identify signaling pathways involved in ΔF508-CFTR rescue, we screened a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs (esiRNAs) that target ∼750 different kinases and associated signaling proteins. We identified 20 novel suppressors of ΔF508-CFTR maturation, including the FGFR1. These were subsequently validated by measuring channel activity by the YFP halide-sensitive assay following shRNA-mediated knockdown, immunoblotting for the mature (band C) ΔF508-CFTR and measuring the amount of surface ΔF508-CFTR by ELISA. The role of FGFR signaling on ΔF508-CFTR trafficking was further elucidated by knocking down FGFRs and their downstream signaling proteins: Erk1/2, Akt, PLCγ-1, and FRS2. Interestingly, inhibition of FGFR1 with SU5402 administered to intestinal organoids (mini-guts) generated from the ileum of ΔF508-CFTR homozygous mice resulted in a robust ΔF508-CFTR rescue. Moreover, combination of SU5402 and VX-809 treatments in cells led to an additive enhancement of ΔF508-CFTR rescue, suggesting these compounds operate by different mechanisms. Chaperone array analysis on human bronchial epithelial cells harvested from ΔF508/ΔF508-CFTR transplant patients treated with SU5402 identified altered expression of several chaperones, an effect validated by their overexpression or knockdown experiments. We propose that FGFR signaling regulates specific chaperones that control ΔF508-CFTR maturation, and suggest that FGFRs may serve as important targets for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of CF.\n",

      "Clinical studies in patients with cystic fibrosis and G551D-CFTR showed that the group treated with ivacaftor had improved clinical outcomes. To better understand the effect of ivacaftor therapy across the distribution of individual FEV(1) responses, data from Phase 3 studies (STRIVE/ENVISION) were re-examined. In this post-hoc analysis of patients (n = 209) who received 48 weeks of ivacaftor or placebo, patients were assigned to tertiles according to FEV(1) response. These groups were then used to evaluate response (FEV(1), sweat chloride, weight, CFQ-R, and pulmonary exacerbation). The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated for specific thresholds for each outcome. Across all tertiles, numerical improvements in FEV(1), sweat chloride, CFQ-R and the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations were observed in ivacaftor-treated patients: the treatment difference versus placebo was statistically significant for all outcomes in the upper tertile and for some outcomes in the lower and middle tertiles. The NNT for a ≥ 5% improvement in %predicted FEV(1) was 1.90, for a ≥ 5% body weight increase was 5.74, and to prevent a pulmonary exacerbation was 3.85. This analysis suggests that the majority of patients with clinical characteristics similar to STRIVE/ENVISION patients have the potential to benefit from ivacaftor therapy.\n",
      "The underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the loss of epithelial chloride and bicarbonate transport due to mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding the CFTR protein. Ivacaftor is a gene-specific CFTR potentiator that augments in vivo chloride transport in CFTR mutations affecting channel gating. Originally approved for the G511D CFTR mutation, ivacaftor is now approved for eight additional alleles exhibiting gating defects and has also been tested in R117H, a CFTR mutation with residual function that exhibits abnormal gating. P67L is a class 4 conductance (nongating) mutation exhibiting residual CFTR function. We report marked clinical improvement, normalization of spirometry, and dramatic reduction in radiographic structural airway changes after &gt; 1 year of treatment with ivacaftor in a young adult with the compound heterozygous genotype P67L/F508del CFTR. The case suggests that ivacaftor may have a potential benefit for patients with CF with nongating mutations.\n",
      "Twenty-five years after the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene identification, this discovery actually begins to benefit to patients. Increasing our knowledge on CFTR biology, as well as technical progress made in order to screen for new drugs have made therapeutic strategies move an important step forward. It is likely that in the forthcoming years, the panel of molecules available for CF patients will be larger, with new activators and potentiators. The disease by itself may consequently change in its natural history. CF is an example of the so-called personalized medicine, aiming to fit treatment according to patient's genetic background. Ongoing clinical trials may enlarge the actually limited eligible number of CF patients for new drugs such as ivacaftor. Beyond this exciting and promising new therapeutic approach, one may not push symptomatic treatments on the side. Improvements have been made for inhaled antibiotics administration, aiming to simplify patient's life; clinical trials using new molecules able to liquefy mucus or with anti-inflammatory properties are actually underway. One important next step in the care for CF will be to design and conduct early intervention trials in CF infants. Newborn screening program have been widely implanted around the word, and cohorts studies have shown that both functional and structural abnormalities occurred very early, making the therapeutic window of opportunity tight.\n",
      "Ivacaftor is a novel cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator that improves the pulmonary function for patients with CF bearing a G551D CFTR-protein mutation. Because ivacaftor is highly bound (&gt;97%) to plasma proteins, there is the strong possibility that co-administered CF drugs may compete for the same plasma protein binding sites and impact the free drug concentration. This, in turn, could lead to drastic changes in the in vivo efficacy of ivacaftor and therapeutic outcomes. This biochemical study compares the binding affinity of ivacaftor and co-administered CF drugs for human serum albumin (HSA) and α1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP) using surface plasmon resonance and fluorimetric binding assays that measure the displacement of site-selective probes. Because of their ability to strongly compete for the ivacaftor binding sites on HSA and AGP, drug-drug interactions between ivacaftor are to be expected with ducosate, montelukast, ibuprofen, dicloxacillin, omeprazole, and loratadine. The significance of these plasma protein drug-drug interactions is also interpreted in terms of molecular docking simulations. This in vitro study provides valuable insights into the plasma protein drug-drug interactions of ivacaftor with co-administered CF drugs. The data may prove useful in future clinical trials for a staggered treatment that aims to maximize the effective free drug concentration and clinical efficacy of ivacaftor.\n",
      "Ivacaftor is a novel CFTR potentiator that increases CFTR activity and improves clinical outcomes in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with at least one copy of CFTR-G551D. Clinical trials have shown an improvement in lung function, weight and CF pulmonary exacerbation in adults with CFTR-G551D leading to the approval of ivacaftor as a novel CF therapy [1]. In vitro studies of ivacaftor have also shown significant improvements in CFTR chloride channel opening time in other non-G551D CFTR mutations suggesting that ivacaftor may be of benefit to patients with mutations other than gating mutations [2]. R117H-CFTR is a relatively common CFTR mutation that demonstrates an in-vitro response to ivacaftor [2,3]. A clinical trial has suggested that there may be a role for ivacaftor in older patients with R117H-CFTR although this trial did not include patients with very severe CF lung disease [4]. In 2014, ivacaftor was approved in the United States as a treatment for CF subjects aged greater than 6 years old with a copy of R117H-CFTR.

      "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) disease is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (CF transmembrane conductance regulator). F508 deletion is the most represented mutation, and F508del-CFTR is absent of plasma membrane and accumulates into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment. Using specific Ca2+ genetics cameleon probes, we showed in the human bronchial CF epithelial cell line CFBE that ER Ca2+ concentration was strongly increased compared to non-CF (16HBE) cells, and normalized by the F508del-CFTR corrector agent, VX-809. We also showed that ER F508del-CFTR retention increases SERCA (Sarcoplasmic/Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) pump activity whereas PMCA (Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase) activities were reduced in these CF cells compared to corrected CF cells (VX-809) and non-CF cells. We are showing for the first time CFTR/SERCA and CFTR/PMCA interactions that are modulated in CF cells and could explain part of Ca2+ homeostasis deregulation due to mislocalization of F508del-CFTR. Using ER or mitochondria genetics Ca2+ probes, we are showing that ER Ca2+ content, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, SERCA and PMCA pump, activities are strongly affected by the localization of F508del-CFTR protein.\n",

      "The European Pediatric Pharmaceutical Legislation wants children to benefit more from pharmaceutical progress. In rare diseases, concerns have been raised that this legislation might damage research and stymie drug development. We discuss the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its Pediatric Committee (PDCO) in the development of ivacaftor, first-in-class for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with the G551D mutation (and eight other mutations later) and of lumacaftor and ataluren, two more potential break-through CF medications. Ivacaftor was USA-approved early 2012 and six months later in the EU. Registration was based on the same data. We analyzed these drugs' EU pediatric investigation plans (PIPs) and compared the PIP-studies with the pediatric CF studies listed in www.clinicaltrials.gov. The ivacaftor PIP studies appear to reflect what the developer planned anyway, apart from a study in 1-23-month-olds, which has not yet started. The total negotiation time for the current PIP version was approximately 5.5 years. For companies that develop drugs in pediatric diseases, e.g., CF, PIPs represent considerable additional procedural workload with minimal or no additional benefit for the patients. New drugs for pediatric diseases should not be hampered by additional, unnecessary and costly bureaucracy, but be registered as rapidly as possible without compromising safety.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is unique among ion channels in that after its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), its ATP-dependent gating violates microscopic reversibility caused by the intimate involvement of ATP hydrolysis in controlling channel closure. Recent studies suggest a gating model featuring an energetic coupling between opening and closing of the gate in CFTR's transmembrane domains and association and dissociation of its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). We found that permeant ions such as nitrate can increase the open probability (Po) of wild-type (WT) CFTR by increasing the opening rate and decreasing the closing rate. Nearly identical effects were seen with a construct in which activity does not require phosphorylation of the regulatory domain, indicating that nitrate primarily affects ATP-dependent gating steps rather than PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the effects of nitrate on CFTR gating are remarkably similar to those of VX-770 (N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide), a potent CFTR potentiator used in clinics. These include effects on single-channel kinetics of WT CFTR, deceleration of the nonhydrolytic closing rate, and potentiation of the Po of the disease-associated mutant G551D. In addition, both VX-770 and nitrate increased the activity of a CFTR construct lacking NBD2 (ΔNBD2), indicating that these gating effects are independent of NBD dimerization. Nonetheless, whereas VX-770 is equally effective when applied from either side of the membrane, nitrate potentiates gating mainly from the cytoplasmic side, implicating a common mechanism for gating modulation mediated through two separate sites of action.\n",
      "Medicines have made an appreciable contribution to improving health. However, even high-income countries are struggling to fund new premium-priced medicines. This will grow necessitating the development of new models to optimize their use. The objective is to review case histories among health authorities to improve the utilization and expenditure on new medicines. Subsequently, use these to develop exemplar models and outline their implications. A number of issues and challenges were identified from the case histories. These included the low number of new medicines seen as innovative alongside increasing requested prices for their reimbursement, especially for oncology, orphan diseases, diabetes and HCV. Proposed models center on the three pillars of pre-, peri- and post-launch including critical drug evaluation, as well as multi-criteria models for valuing medicines for orphan diseases alongside potentially capping pharmaceutical expenditure. In conclusion, the proposed models involving all key stakeholder groups are critical for the sustainability of healthcare systems or enhancing universal access. The models should help stimulate debate as well as restore trust between key stakeholder groups.\n",
      "Increase of Ca(2+) influx in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) cells has been reported to be related to Transient Receptor Potential Canonical (TRPC6) channel, which is implicated in a functional coupling with Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). Several members of the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid (TRPV) channels family have already been described as emerging target for respiratory diseases. Two specific isoforms, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are of particular interest in the context of CF Ca(2+) homeostasis as they are highly selective toward Ca(2+) and constitutively activated. Thus, we investigated the involvement of these channels in Ca(2+) influx in CF and non-CF human bronchial epithelial cell lines. 16HBE14o-, CFBE41o- cell lines, primary human airway epithelial cells (hAEC) and freshly isolated human airway epithelial cells from CF and non-CF individuals were used. We showed that both channels are expressed in CF and non-CF cells and constitutive Ca(2+) influx was significantly higher (85%) in cells from CF individuals compared to cells from non-CF ones. Using the selective inhibitor of TRPV6 channel SOR-C27 and a siRNA strategy, our results revealed that TRPV6 was mostly involved in the increase of Ca(2+) influx. TRPV6 channel is negatively regulated by the PLC-PIP2 pathway. We measured the Ca(2+) influx in the presence of the non-specific PLC inhibitor, U73122, in non-CF human bronchial epithelial cells. Ca(2+) influx was increased by 33% with U73122 and this increase was largely reduced in the presence of SOR-C27. PLC inhibition in CF cells by U73122 had no effect on Ca(2+) influx. These results showed that PLC-PIP2 pathway is dysregulated in CF cells and leads to the increase of TRPV6 activity. The regulation of TRPV6 by PLC-PIP2 pathway implicates the specific PLC isoform, PLC-δ1. Immunoblot experiments revealed that expression of PLC-δ1 was decreased by 70% in CF cells. TRPV6 activity was normalized but not the level of expression of PLC-δ1 protein after F508del-CFTR rescue by low temperature for 48 h or treated for 24 h by 10 μM VX-809 in CF cells. This study revealed TRPV6 and PLC-δ1 as critical actor of Ca(2+) homeostasis in CF human bronchial epithelial cells.\n",

We report the early results on clinical outcomes, sweat electrolytes and C-reactive protein in three adults with a G551D mutation and advanced lung disease. A mean increase of 6% in FEV1 was observed at 2 weeks and a mean reduction in sweat chloride of -48.9 mmol/L.

For individuals with CF and at least one copy of the G551D gating mutation, improvements in sweat chloride, nutritional parameters, lung function, respiratory symptoms, and exercise tolerance (i.e., 6-min walk distance) are attained within 2 weeks of initiating ivacaftor. However, there are no reports detailing the physiological and sensory implications of these improvements and their underlying mechanisms. We performed detailed cardiopulmonary exercise testing pre- and post-initiation of ivacaftor in a 27-year old male with CF (CFTR genotype F508del/G551D) and chronic airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC=0.44). An improvement of FEV1 (by 16%) following ivacaftor was accompanied by clinically significant improvements in exercise capacity (by 14%) and exertional dyspnea (by up to 5 Borg scale units). These improvements were attributable, at least in part, to favorable alterations in the ventilatory response to exercise, including improvements in breathing patterns (e.g., increased tidal volume and reduced breathing frequency) and dynamic operating lung volumes (e.g., increased inspiratory reserve volume and inspiratory capacity) and decreases in dynamic mechanical ventilatory constraints.\n",

After years of study, the fiction of personalized treatment has turned to hope. Basic information about CFTR mutations classes and new treatments is needed if we are to deal properly with the new CF era. The problems involved in this issue, however, should be evaluated with greater care and attention. VX-770 is a new drug available to treat CF patients with some class III CFTR mutations and other drugs are being studied regarding other classes. The scientific literature has constantly given information about each therapy, both in vitro and in vivo. The hope is increasing. Nevertheless the &quot;scientific world&quot; still lacks information about patients' reality and daily health related practical needs. Clinical trials have showed good evaluation of some drugs so far, but clinical response is a wide spectrum yet to be analyzed: CFTR mutations spectrum, costs related to the treatment with new drugs (for VX-770 therapy), variability of CF clinical expression, limitations to test in vitro drugs, absence of good clinical markers to evaluate drug response, absence of long-term studies and with patients below six years old, multidrug treatment used to improve the expression response, and finally, the most important problem, who will benefit from the new drugs therapy, are issues that constitute a barrier that should be overcome.

Following its partial rescue, the open probability of F508del-CFTR is enhanced by the potentiator compound, VX-770. However, the channel activity of rescued F508del-CFTR remains less than that of the Wt-CFTR protein in the presence of VX-770. In this study, we asked if there are allosteric effects of F508del on the phosphorylation-regulated R domain. To identify defects in the R domain, we compared the phosphorylation status at protein kinase A sites in the R domain of Wt and F508del-CFTR. Here we show that phosphorylation of Ser-660, quantified by SRM-MS, is reduced in F508del-CFTR. Although the generation of a phosphomimic at this site (substituting aspartic acid for serine) did not modify the maturation defect, it did enhance F508del-CFTR channel function after pharmacological rescue with corrector VX-809, and treatment with the potentiator, VX-770. These findings support the concept that defective phosphorylation of F508del-CFTR partially accounts for its altered channel activity at the cell surface.\n",

      "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is a membrane-integral protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis in which salt, water, and protein transports are defective in various tissues. To investigate the conformation of the CFTR in the membrane, we applied the small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) technique on microsomal membranes extracted from NIH/3T3 cells permanentely transfected with wild-type (WT) CFTR and with CFTR carrying the ΔF508 mutation. The electronic density profile of the membranes was calculated from the SAXS data, assuming the lipid bilayer electronic density to be composed by a series of Gaussian shells. The data indicate that membranes in the microsome vesicles, that contain mostly endoplasmic reticulum membranes, are oriented in the outside-out conformation. Phosphorylation does not change significantly the electronic density profile, while dephosphorylation produces a significant modification in the inner side of the profile. Thus, we conclude that the CFTR and its associated protein complex in microsomes are mostly phosphorylated. The electronic density profile of the ΔF508-CFTR microsomes is completely different from WT, suggesting a different assemblage of the proteins in the membranes. Low-temperature treatment of cells rescues the ΔF508-CFTR protein, resulting in a conformation that resembles the WT. Differently, treatment with the corrector VX-809 modifies the electronic profile of ΔF508-CFTR membrane, but does not recover completely the WT conformation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a direct physical measurement of the structure of membranes containing CFTR in its native environment and in different functional and pharmacological conditions.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic life-shortening condition in Caucasians. Despite being a multi-organ disease, CF is classically diagnosed by symptoms of acute/chronic respiratory disease, with persistent pulmonary infections and mucus plugging of the airways and failure to thrive. These multiple symptoms originate from dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a channel that mediates anion transport across epithelia. Indeed, establishment of a definite CF diagnosis requires proof of CFTR dysfunction, commonly through the so-called sweat Cl(-) test. Many drug therapies, including mucolytics and antibiotics, aim to alleviate the symptoms of CF lung disease. However, new therapies to modulate defective CFTR, the basic defect underlying CF, have started to reach the clinic, and several others are in development or in clinical trials. The novelty of these therapies is that, besides targeting the basic defect underlying CF, they are mutation specific. Indeed, even this monogenic disease is influenced by a large number of different genes and biological pathways as well as by environmental factors that are difficult to assess. Accordingly, every person with CF is unique and so functional assessment of patients' tissues ex vivo is key for diagnosing and predicting the severity of this disease. Of note, such assessment will also be crucial to assess drug responses, in order to effectively treat all CF patients. It is not because it is a monogenic disorder that personalized treatment for CF is much easier than for complex disorders.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common lethal genetic diseases, is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a chloride channel that, when phosphorylated, is gated by ATP. The third most common pathogenic mutation, a glycine-to-aspartate mutation at position 551 or G551D, shows a significantly decreased open probability (Po) caused by failure of the mutant channel to respond to ATP. Recently, a CFTR-targeted drug, VX-770 (Ivacaftor), which potentiates G551D-CFTR function in vitro by boosting its Po, has been approved by the FDA to treat CF patients carrying this mutation. Here, we show that, in the presence of VX-770, G551D-CFTR becomes responsive to ATP, albeit with an unusual time course. In marked contrast to wild-type channels, which are stimulated by ATP, sudden removal of ATP in excised inside-out patches elicits an initial increase in macroscopic G551D-CFTR current followed by a slow decrease. Furthermore, decreasing [ATP] from 2 mM to 20 µM resulted in a paradoxical increase in G551D-CFTR current. These results suggest that the two ATP-binding sites in the G551D mutant mediate opposite effects on channel gating. We introduced mutations that specifically alter ATP-binding affinity in either nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1 or NBD2) into the G551D background and determined that this disease-associated mutation converts site 2, formed by the head subdomain of NBD2 and the tail subdomain of NBD1, into an inhibitory site, whereas site 1 remains stimulatory. G551E, but not G551K or G551S, exhibits a similar phenotype, indicating that electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged side chain of aspartate and the γ-phosphate of ATP accounts for the observed mutational effects. Understanding the molecular mechanism of this gating defect lays a foundation for rational drug design for the treatment of CF.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common recessively inherited monogenic disorders in the Caucasian population. The disease develops when pathogenic mutations of the CFTR gene, encoding a transmembrane conductance regulator, are present in both alleles. Cystic fibrosis is a multi-organ disease with heterozygous clinical course. High mortality of the disease is mainly due to progressive and irreversible changes in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure. Therefore, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the primary target in the search for effective therapeutic solutions. In recent years there has been a significant progress in the research on early diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. The newest strategies focus not only on the main symptoms of pulmonary disease (inflammation caused by bacterial infection and obstruction due to thickened mucus), but also on the correction of the cystic fibrosis cause - defective CFTR gene and its protein product. Therapeutics like VX-770 and PTC124, intended for patients with a specific genotype, have already emerged on the U.S. and European medical market. They modulate the defective CFTR protein function or act on the level of abnormal CFTR mRNA, respectively. At the same time scientists develop new solutions in the field of somatic gene therapy in order to increase the efficiency of corrected CFTR delivery to the respiratory tract cells and to maintain its expression in the target cells. In this review we discuss the progress achieved in the development of therapy that is at the stage of both preclinical and clinical phases.\n",

      "In patients with Cystic Fibrosis and a type III mutation, ivacaftor (Kalydeco(®), Vertex) can increase the opening time of the CFTR channel and improve chloride transport. Research showed significant improvement of lung function and increase in weight following ivacaftor use. However, ivacaftor showed to have adverse events on the sinonasal system as well, such as upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion and headaches. This case report showed a positive effect of ivacaftor on the sinonasal pathology in a 17 year old patient with CF. After 5 months of ivacaftor use, the CT-sinus showed complete resolution of the opacification of the paranasal sinuses and a decrease in symptoms of sinonasal disease. This positive effect of ivacaftor on sinonasal pathology seems promising, therefore more research is needed to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on the upper airways in CF.\n",
      "The G551D cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation is associated with severe disease in ∼5% of cystic fibrosis patients worldwide. This amino acid substitution in NBD1 results in a CFTR chloride channel characterized by a severe gating defect that can be at least partially overcome in vitro by exposure to a CFTR potentiator. In contrast, the more common ΔF508 mutation is associated with a severe protein trafficking defect, as well as impaired channel function. Recent clinical trials demonstrated a beneficial effect of the CFTR potentiator, Ivacaftor (VX-770), on lung function of patients bearing at least one copy of G551D CFTR, but no comparable effect on ΔF508 homozygotes. This difference in efficacy was not surprising in view of the established difference in the molecular phenotypes of the two mutant channels. Recently, however, it was shown that the structural defect introduced by the deletion of F508 is associated with the thermal instability of ΔF508 CFTR channel function in vitro. This additional mutant phenotype raised the possibility that the differences in the behavior of ΔF508 and G551D CFTR, as well as the disparate efficacy of Ivacaftor, might be a reflection of the differing thermal stabilities of the two channels at 37 °C. We compared the thermal stability of G551D and ΔF508 CFTR in Xenopus oocytes in the presence and absence of CTFR potentiators. G551D CFTR exhibited a thermal instability that was comparable to that of ΔF508 CFTR. G551D CFTR, however, was protected from thermal instability by CFTR potentiators, whereas ΔF508 CFTR was not. These results suggest that the efficacy of VX-770 in patients bearing the G551D mutation is due, at least in part, to the ability of the small molecule to protect the mutant channel from thermal instability at human body temperature.\n",
      "Ivacaftor is an oral bioavailable potentiator of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. It is the first therapeutic agent that has been registered for clinical use which targets the basic defect in people with cystic fibrosis who carry a G551D mutation or other rarer specific gating mutations. Clinical trials have shown consistent and impressive clinical benefit that appears to be sustained over time in people with cystic fibrosis who carry a G551D mutation and similar benefits have been seen in those who carry rarer gating mutations. Ivacaftor is orally administered twice daily with a dose that does not vary between children aged 6 years through to adult life in patients with G551D. It appears to be well tolerated although there are potential interactions with drugs that are metabolised through CYPP450 CYP3A. Ivacaftor is also currently being trialled in combination with correctors for patients with the most common mutation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator the F508del mutation.\n",

      "Ivacaftor is approved in the USA for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients with a G551D-CFTR mutation or one of eight other CFTR mutations. A series of in vitro experiments conducted early in the development of ivacaftor indicated ivacaftor and metabolites may have the potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A, and CYP2D6, as well as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Based on these results, a series of clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on sensitive substrates of CYP2C8 (rosiglitazone), CYP3A (midazolam), CYP2D6 (desipramine), and P-gp (digoxin). In addition, a DDI study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on a combined oral contraceptive, as this is considered an important comedication in CF patients. The results indicate ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp, but has no effect on CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Ivacaftor caused non-clinically significant increases in ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone exposure. Based on these results, caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended when concomitant substrates of CYP2C9, CYP3A and/or P-gp are used during treatment with ivacaftor, particularly drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as warfarin.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) that result in reduced anion conductance at the apical membrane of secretory epithelia. Treatment of CF patients carrying the G551D gating mutation with the potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor) largely restores channel activity and has shown substantial clinical benefit. However, most CF patients carry the ΔF508 mutation, which impairs CFTR folding, processing, function, and stability. Studies in homozygous ΔF508 CF patients indicated little clinical benefit of monotherapy with the investigational corrector VX-809 (lumacaftor) or VX-770, whereas combination clinical trials show limited but significant improvements in lung function. We show that VX-770, as well as most other potentiators, reduces the correction efficacy of VX-809 and another investigational corrector, VX-661. To mimic the administration of VX-770 alone or in combination with VX-809, we examined its long-term effect in immortalized and primary human respiratory epithelia. VX-770 diminished the folding efficiency and the metabolic stability of ΔF508-CFTR at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-ER compartments, respectively, causing reduced cell surface ΔF508-CFTR density and function. VX-770-induced destabilization of ΔF508-CFTR was influenced by second-site suppressor mutations of the folding defect and was prevented by stabilization of the nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1)-NBD2 interface. The reduced correction efficiency of ΔF508-CFTR, as well as of two other processing mutations in the presence of VX-770, suggests the need for further optimization of potentiators to maximize the clinical benefit of corrector-potentiator combination therapy in CF.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Newly developed &quot;correctors&quot; such as lumacaftor (VX-809) that improve CFTR maturation and trafficking and &quot;potentiators&quot; such as ivacaftor (VX-770) that enhance channel activity may provide important advances in CF therapy. Although VX-770 has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in the small subset of patients with a mutation (G551D) that affects only channel activity, a single compound is not sufficient to treat patients with the more common CFTR mutation, ΔF508. Thus, patients with ΔF508 will likely require treatment with both correctors and potentiators to achieve clinical benefit. However, whereas the effectiveness of acute treatment with this drug combination has been demonstrated in vitro, the impact of chronic therapy has not been established. In studies of human primary airway epithelial cells, we found that both acute and chronic treatment with VX-770 improved CFTR function in cells with the G551D mutation, consistent with clinical studies. In contrast, chronic VX-770 administration caused a dose-dependent reversal of VX-809-mediated CFTR correction in ΔF508 homozygous cultures. This result reflected the destabilization of corrected ΔF508 CFTR by VX-770, markedly increasing its turnover rate. Chronic VX-770 treatment also reduced mature wild-type CFTR levels and function. These findings demonstrate that chronic treatment with CFTR potentiators and correctors may have unexpected effects that cannot be predicted from short-term studies. Combining these drugs to maximize rescue of ΔF508 CFTR may require changes in dosing and/or development of new potentiator compounds that do not interfere with CFTR stability.\n",

      "The cause of insulin insufficiency remains unknown in many diabetic cases. Up to 50% adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), develop CF-related diabetes (CFRD) with most patients exhibiting insulin insufficiency. Here we show that CFTR is a regulator of glucose-dependent electrical acitivities and insulin secretion in β-cells. We demonstrate that glucose elicited whole-cell currents, membrane depolarization, electrical bursts or action potentials, Ca(2+) oscillations and insulin secretion are abolished or reduced by inhibitors or knockdown of CFTR in primary mouse β-cells or RINm5F β-cell line, or significantly attenuated in CFTR mutant (DF508) mice compared with wild-type mice. VX-809, a newly discovered corrector of DF508 mutation, successfully rescues the defects in DF508 β-cells. Our results reveal a role of CFTR in glucose-induced electrical activities and insulin secretion in β-cells, shed light on the pathogenesis of CFRD and possibly other idiopathic diabetes, and present a potential treatment strategy.\n",

First of all, among the notable 2012 approvals, is ivacaftor or Kalydeco®. This is the first treatment that targets one of the gene defects that is underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. This is also an example of the promise of personalized medicine. The benefits with bedaquiline or Sirturo® are its ability to likely provide clinically relevant activity as part of multi-drug regimens against tuberculosis (TB) based on clinical data in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) patients, who were defined as being at least resistant against the two major tuberculostatic medicines (isaoniazide and rifampicine). On December 2012 and then, on December 2013, the FDA and European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorization for Sirturo® (bedaquiline), respectively, for use as part of a combination therapy for pulmonary multidrug resistant tuberculosis in adult patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability. Amyvid®, which is a solution for injection that contains the active substance florbetapir (18F), is a radiopharmaceutical that emits low amounts of radiation and works by targeting and attaching to β-amyloid plaques in the brain. This enables doctors to know whether or not significant amount of plaques are present in order to know if the patient is unlikely or not, to have Alzheimer's disease.

      "The mutated protein F508del-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) failed to traffic properly as a result of its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as a chloride (Cl(-)) channel with abnormal gating and endocytosis. Small chemicals (called correctors) individually restore F508del-CFTR trafficking and Cl(-) transport function, but recent findings indicate that synergistic pharmacology should be considered to address CFTR defects more clearly. We studied the function and maturation of F508del-CFTR expressed in HeLa cells using a combination of five correctors [miglustat, IsoLAB (1,4-dideoxy-2-hydroxymethyl-1,4-imino-l-threitol), Corr4a (N-[2-(5-chloro-2-methoxy-phenylamino)-4'-methyl-[4,5']bithiazolyl-2'-yl]-benzamide), VX-809 [3-(6-(1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamido)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl)benzoic acid], and suberoylamilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)]. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, the current density recorded in response to CFTR activators (forskolin + genistein) was significantly increased in the presence of the following combinations: VX-809 + IsoLAB; VX-809 + miglustat + SAHA; VX-809 + miglustat + IsoLAB; VX-809 + IsoLAB + SAHA; VX-809 + miglustat + IsoLAB + SAHA. These combinations restored the activity of F508del-CFTR but with a differential effect on the appearance of mature c-band of F508del-CFTR proteins. Focusing on the VX-809 + IsoLAB cocktail, we recorded a level of correction higher at 37°C versus room temperature, but without amelioration of the thermal instability of CFTR. The level of functional rescue with VX-809 + IsoLAB after 4 hours of incubation was maximal and similar to that obtained in optimal conditions of use for each compound (i.e., 24 hours for VX-809 + 4 hours for IsoLAB). Finally, we compared the stimulation of F508del-CFTR by forskolin or forskolin + VX-770 [N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide] with cells corrected by VX-809 + IsoLAB. Our results open new perspectives for the development of a synergistic polypharmacology to rescue F508del-CFTR and show the importance of temperature on the effect of correctors and on the level of correction, suggesting that optimized combination of correctors could lead to a better rescue of F508del-CFTR function.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in CFTR, a plasma-membrane-localized anion channel. The most common mutation in CFTR, deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (ΔF508), causes misfolding of CFTR resulting in little or no protein at the plasma membrane. The CFTR corrector VX-809 shows promise for treating CF patients homozygous for ΔF508. Here, we demonstrate the significance of protein-protein interactions in enhancing the stability of the ΔF508 CFTR mutant channel protein at the plasma membrane. We determined that VX-809 prolongs the stability of ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane. Using competition-based assays, we demonstrated that ΔF508 CFTR interacts poorly with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) compared to wild-type CFTR, and VX-809 significantly increased this binding affinity. We conclude that stabilized CFTR-NHERF1 interaction is a determinant of the functional efficiency of rescued ΔF508 CFTR. Our results demonstrate the importance of macromolecular-complex formation in stabilizing rescued mutant CFTR at the plasma membrane and suggest this to be foundational for the development of a new generation of effective CFTR-corrector-based therapeutics.\n",
      "Studies have endeavored to reconcile whether dysfunction of neutrophils in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) is a result of the genetic defect or is secondary due to infection and inflammation. In this study, we illustrate that disrupted function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), such as that which occurs in patients with ∆F508 and/or G551D mutations, correlates with impaired degranulation of antimicrobial proteins. We demonstrate that CF blood neutrophils release less secondary and tertiary granule components compared with control cells and that activation of the low-molecular-mass GTP-binding protein Rab27a, involved in the regulation of granule trafficking, is defective. The mechanism leading to impaired degranulation involves altered ion homeostasis caused by defective CFTR function with increased cytosolic levels of chloride and sodium, yet decreased magnesium measured in CF neutrophils. Decreased magnesium concentration in vivo and in vitro resulted in significantly decreased levels of GTP-bound Rab27a. Treatment of G551D patients with the ion channel potentiator ivacaftor resulted in normalized neutrophil cytosolic ion levels and activation of Rab27a, thereby leading to increased degranulation and bacterial killing. Our results confirm that intrinsic alterations of circulating neutrophils from patients with CF are corrected by ivacaftor, thus illustrating additional clinical benefits for CFTR modulator therapy.\n",
      "With the discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989, the search for therapies to improve the basic defects of cystic fibrosis (CF) commenced. Pharmacological manipulation provides the opportunity to enhance CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein synthesis and/or function. CFTR modulators include potentiators to improve channel gating (class III mutations), correctors to improve abnormal CFTR protein folding and trafficking (class II mutations) and stop codon mutation read-through drugs relevant for patients with premature stop codons (most class I mutations). After several successful clinical trials the potentiator, ivacaftor, is now licenced for use in adults and children (&gt;six years), with CF bearing the class III G551D mutation and FDA licence was recently expanded to include 8 additional class III mutations. Alternative approaches for class I and class II mutations are currently being studied. Combination drug treatment with correctors and potentiators appears to be required to restore CFTR function of F508del, the most common CFTR mutation. Alternative therapies such as gene therapy and pharmacological modulation of other ion channels may be advantageous because they are mutation-class independent, however progress is less well advanced. Clinical trials for CFTR modulators have been enthusiastically embraced by patients with CF and health care providers. Whilst novel trial end-points are being evaluated allowing CFTR modulators to be efficiently tested, many challenges related to the complexity of CFTR and the biology of the epithelium still need to be overcome.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiators and correctors are new drugs that target the basic CFTR protein defect and are expected to benefit cystic fibrosis patients. To optimize the substances so far proposed for human use, and to minimise unwanted side effects, it is essential to investigate possible interactions between the drugs and cell components. We used small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron radiation to analyse the effects of two representative drugs, the potentiator VX-770 (Ivacaftor), approved for human use, and the corrector VX-809 (Lumacaftor), on a model phospholipid membrane. By reconstruction of the electron density profile of unilamellar vesicles treated with VX-770 or VX-809 we found that these drugs penetrate the phospholipid bilayer. VX-809 becomes homogeneously distributed throughout the bilayer whereas VX-770 accumulates predominantly in the internal leaflet, behaviour probably favoured by the asymmetry of the bilayer, because of vesicle curvature. Penetration of the bilayer by these drugs, probably as part of the mechanisms of permeation, causes destabilization of the membrane; this must be taken into account during future drug development.\n",
      "The most prevalent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation causing cystic fibrosis, ΔF508, impairs folding of nucleotide binding domain (NBD) 1 and stability of the interface between NBD1 and the membrane-spanning domains. The interfacial stability defect can be partially corrected by the investigational drug VX-809 (3-[6-[[[1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl]amino]-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl]-benzoic acid) or the R1070W mutation. Second-generation ΔF508-CFTR correctors are needed to improve on the modest efficacy of existing cystic fibrosis correctors. We postulated that a second corrector targeting a distinct folding/interfacial defect might act in synergy with VX-809 or the R1070W suppressor mutation. A biochemical screen for ΔF508-CFTR cell surface expression was developed in a human lung epithelium-derived cell line (CFBE41o(-)) by expressing chimeric CFTRs with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the fourth exofacial loop in either the presence or absence of R1070W. Using a luminescence readout of HRP activity, screening of approximately 110,000 small molecules produced nine novel corrector scaffolds that increased cell surface ∆F508-CFTR expression by up to 200% in the presence versus absence of maximal VX-809. Further screening of 1006 analogs of compounds identified from the primary screen produced 15 correctors with an EC50 &lt; 5 µM. Eight chemical scaffolds showed synergy with VX-809 in restoring chloride permeability in ∆F508-expressing A549 cells. An aminothiazole increased chloride conductance in human bronchial epithelial cells from a ΔF508 homozygous subject beyond that of maximal VX-809. Mechanistic studies suggested that NBD2 is required for the aminothiazole rescue. Our results provide proof of concept for synergy screening to identify second-generation correctors, which, when used in combination, may overcome the &quot;therapeutic ceiling&quot; of first-generation correctors.\n",

Cell culture and patient tissue-based assays confirm that in addition to their cotranslational effect on folding, certain corrector compounds bind to the full-length F508del-CFTR after its partial rescue to the cell surface to enhance its function. These findings may inform the development of alternative compounds with improved therapeutic efficacy.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening disease arising as a consequence of mutations within the CFTR gene. Novel therapeutics for CF are emerging that target CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) defects resulting from specific CFTR variants. Ivacaftor is a drug that potentiates CFTR gating function and is specifically indicated for CF patients with a particular CFTR variant, G551D-CFTR (rs75527207). Here, we provide therapeutic recommendations for ivacaftor based on preemptive CFTR genotype results.\n",

      "To determine if oral dosing with the CFTR-potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770, Kalydeco) improves CFTR-dependent sweating in CF subjects carrying G551D or R117H-5T mutations, we optically measured sweat secretion from 32-143 individually identified glands in each of 8 CF subjects; 6 F508del/G551D, one G551D/R117H-5T, and one I507del/R117H-5T. Two subjects were tested only (-) ivacaftor, 3 only (+) ivacaftor and 3 (+/-) ivacaftor (1-5 tests per condition). The total number of gland measurements was 852 (-) ivacaftor and 906 (+) ivacaftor. A healthy control was tested 4 times (51 glands). For each gland we measured both CFTR-independent (M-sweat) and CFTR-dependent (C-sweat); C-sweat was stimulated with a β-adrenergic cocktail that elevated [cAMP]i while blocking muscarinic receptors. Absent ivacaftor, almost all CF glands produced M-sweat on all tests, but only 1/593 glands produced C-sweat (10 tests, 5 subjects). By contrast, 6/6 subjects (113/342 glands) produced C-sweat in the (+) ivacaftor condition, but with large inter-subject differences; 3-74% of glands responded with C/M sweat ratios 0.04%-2.57% of the average WT ratio of 0.265. Sweat volume losses cause proportionally larger underestimates of CFTR function at lower sweat rates. The losses were reduced by measuring C/M ratios in 12 glands from each subject that had the highest M-sweat rates. Remaining losses were estimated from single channel data and used to correct the C/M ratios, giving estimates of CFTR function (+) ivacaftor  = 1.6%-7.7% of the WT average. These estimates are in accord with single channel data and transcript analysis, and suggest that significant clinical benefit can be produced by low levels of CFTR function.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis is caused by dysfunction or deficiency of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an epithelial chloride channel that has a key role in maintaining homoeostasis of the airway surface liquid layer in the lungs. More than 1900 CFTR mutations that might result in a disease phenotype have been identified; these can be grouped into classes on the basis of their effect on CFTR protein production, trafficking, function, and stability. In the past 2 years, landmark clinical trials have shown that correction of CFTR function leads to substantial clinical benefit for individuals with cystic fibrosis. These findings are ushering in a new era of cystic fibrosis treatments designed to correct the underlying CFTR defect caused by different mutation classes. With analysis of continuing trials and available patient registries, here we assess mutation types and the number and geographical distribution of patients who are likely to benefit from CFTR-correcting treatment.\n",

      "Processing mutations that inhibit folding and trafficking of CFTR are the main cause of cystic fibrosis. Repair of CFTR mutants requires an understanding of the mechanisms of misfolding caused by processing mutations. Previous studies on helix-loop-helix fragments of the V232D processing mutation suggested that its mechanism was to lock transmembrane (TM) segments 3 and 4 together by a non-native hydrogen bond (Asp232(TM4)/Gln207(TM3)). Here, we performed mutational analysis to test for Asp232/Gln207 interactions in full-length CFTR. The rationale was that a V232N mutation should mimic V232D and a V232D/Q207A mutant should mature if the processing defect was caused by hydrogen bonds. We report that only Val232 mutations to charged amino acids severely blocked CFTR maturation. The V232N mutation did not mimic V232D as V232N showed 40% maturation compared to 2% for V232D. Mutation of Val232 to large nonpolar residues (Leu, Phe) had little effect. The Q207L mutation did not rescue V232D because Q207L showed about 50% maturation in the presence of corrector VX-809 while V232D/Q207A could no longer be rescued. These results suggest that V232D inhibits maturation by disrupting a hydrophobic pocket between TM segments rather than forming a non-native hydrogen bond. Disulfide cross-linking analysis of cysteines W356C(TM6) and W1145C(TM12) suggest that the V232D mutation inhibits maturation by trapping CFTR as a partially folded intermediate. Since correctors can efficiently rescue V232D CFTR, the results suggest that hydrophilic processing mutations facing a hydrophobic pocket are good candidates for rescue with pharmacological chaperones.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by defects in the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an epithelial chloride channel. The most common mutation, Δ508CFTR, produces a protein that is misfolded and does not reach the cell membrane. The discovery that partial chloride channel function could be restored by exposure to exogenous chemical stimuli led to the search for selective CFTR modulators. Vertex has led the way in developing N-aryl-1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide derivatives such as lumacaftor and VX-661, which correct trafficking of Δ508CFTR and partially restore chloride channel activity. Novartis had identified similar activity in a series of picolinamide derivatives such as 3-amino-N-[(2S)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl]-5,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyridine-2-carboxamide. A series of five filings from Novartis has expanded on the activity of compounds based on this scaffold and provided compounds with nanomolar potency in cellular assays.\n",
      "Ivacaftor is the first novel cystic fibrosis pharmaceutical that acts at the molecular level to potentiate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function and was first approved for clinical use in 2012. We are sharing our single center experience of five patients: four from pediatric age group and one adult patient. All patients had both subjective and objective improvements in their health. Despite established lung disease, our patients had significant improvement in both their FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and FEF25-75 and BMI (body mass index). Larger studies demonstrated only 6.7% improvement in mean FEV1 after starting Ivacaftor therapy but their patient population had normal lung function to begin with. In contrast our case series demonstrates that, in patients with established lung disease and diminished lung function, Ivacaftor can be expected to result in much higher recovery in lung function. Mean FEV1 improved by 35% in our case series. Ivacaftor is extremely expensive, costing $300,000 per patient per year requiring lifelong therapy, hence requiring prior authorizations from most third-party payers in the USA. The knowledge shared from our experience will be useful for other clinicians to petition healthcare policymakers on behalf of their patients.\n",

      "We present the recent therapeutic advances in the cystic fibrosis care. It concerns improvements in symptomatic treatment with the development of dry powder inhaled antibiotics that improved quality of life, and innovative treatments namely the modulators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane protein conductance regulator (CFTR), molecules which act specifically at the level of the defective mechanisms implied in the disease. The life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients born after 2000, is estimated now to be about 50 years. This improvement of survival was obtained with the organization of the care within the specialized centers for cystic fibrosis (Centre de ressource et de compétences de la mucoviscidose) and remains still based on heavy symptomatic treatments. Dry powder inhaled antibiotics constitute a significant time saving for patients to whom all the care can achieve two hours daily. Since 2012, the modulators of CFTR, molecules allowing a pharmacological approach targeted according to the type of the mutations, allows a more specific approach of the disease. Ivacaftor (Kalydeco(®)) which potentialises the function of the CFTR protein expressed on the cellular surface is now available for patients with the G551D mutation. Lumacaftor is going to be tested in association with ivacaftor in patients with the F508del mutation, that is present in at least 75% of the patients. The ataluren which allows the production of a functional protein CFTR in patients with a no sense mutation is the third representing of this new therapeutic class. We presently have numerous symptomatic treatments for the cystic fibrosis care. The development of CFTR modulators, today available to a restricted number of patients treated with ivacaftor represents a very promising therapeutic avenue. It will represent probably the first step to a personalized treatment according to CFTR genotype.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disease due to mutations in the gene encoding CFTR (Cystic FibrosisTransmembrane conductance Regulator), a protein involved in cellular transmembrane transport, particularly of chloride ions. Ivacaftor is described as a selective potentiator of CFTR protein. It is now licensed for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients 6 years of age and older who carry the CFTR G551D mutation, which is the case for about 4% to 5% of cystic fibrosis patients. Two randomised placebo-controlled trials of ivacaftor have been carried out in this setting, in a total of 213 patients. The frequency of pulmonary exacerbations fell in one of the two trials during the first 48 weeks of treatment, but there was no impact on the number of hospitalisations or the use of intravenous antibiotics. In both trials, addition of ivacaftor improved FEV1 by an average of about 10% at week 24 and increased body weight by an average of about 2.5 kg after 1 year. Upper respiratory tract infections occurred in the ivacaftor groups during these trials, with more cases of bacterial contamination and, possibly, more pulmonary exacerbations in the longer term. Ivacaftorcarries a risk of numerous pharmacokinetic interactions that can require dose adjustment, particularly for patients with hepatic impairment and those receiving cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A inhibitors or inducers. Given the absence of data, ivacaftor should be avoided during pregnancy. In practice, in 2013, it is not possible to determine the harm-benefit balance of ivacaftor due to the high risk of drug interactions, as well as a possible increased risk of infections and liver toxicity.\n",

In a cohort of 24 adults who were prescribed Ivacaftor, there was no correlation between absolute or relative reductions in sweat chloride and improvements in lung function. This questions the validity of sweat chloride as a surrogate marker of clinical efficacy.\n",
      "New drugs are needed to enhance premature termination codon (PTC) suppression to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) and other diseases caused by nonsense mutations. We tested new synthetic aminoglycoside derivatives expressly developed for PTC suppression in a series of complementary CF models. Using a dual-luciferase reporter system containing the four most prevalent CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) nonsense mutations (G542X, R553X, R1162X, and W1282X) within their local sequence contexts (the three codons on either side of the PTC), we found that NB124 promoted the most readthrough of G542X, R1162X, and W1282X PTCs. NB124 also restored full-length CFTR expression and chloride transport in Fischer rat thyroid cells stably transduced with a CFTR-G542XcDNA transgene, and was superior to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides tested. NB124 restored CFTR function to roughly 7% of wild-type activity in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) CF cells (G542X/delF508), a highly relevant preclinical model with endogenous CFTR expression. Efficacy was further enhanced by addition of the CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor (VX-770), to airway cells expressing CFTR PTCs. NB124 treatment rescued CFTR function in a CF mouse model expressing a human CFTR-G542X transgene; efficacy was superior to gentamicin and exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties, suggesting that in vitro results translated to clinical benefit in vivo. NB124 was also less cytotoxic than gentamicin in a tissue-based model for ototoxicity. These results provide evidence that NB124 and other synthetic aminoglycosides provide a 10-fold improvement in therapeutic index over gentamicin and other first-generation aminoglycosides, providing a promising treatment for a wide array of CFTR nonsense mutations.\n",

      "Targeted therapies provide clinical benefit and improved therapeutic index. They have a growing prominence in patient management and focus in drug development. Their development is fuelled by our deepening knowledge of complex disease phenotypes and the need for improvement in new therapeutic efficacy. Extrapolation of the biological discovery through to new therapy targeting the causal biological variants to drive clinical gain is challenging. Here, we review the impact of germline mutations on targeted therapies. Historically, germline changes have contributed most to our understanding of disease mechanisms, drug metabolism and exposure, the latter of which has enabled safer positioning of therapies, such as clopidogrel and irinotecan. Similarly, prescreening for germline variants can avoid potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir. However, germline mutations continue to emerge as a central player in targeting therapeutics; ivacaftor drives partial restoration of mucus secretion in cystic fibrosis patients harbouring specific mutations, and treatment with olaparib exploits germline mutations in BRCA genes to drive synthetic lethality as an anti-cancer mechanism. Central is definition of the causal link, association or contribution to the biological variance - and that we believe it is drugable for therapeutic gain. The demand for better therapies to treat modern diseases provides the appetite for continued investigation of the biological variance associated with germline mutations, inevitably leading to increased impact on the development of targeted therapeutics.\n",
      "Cigarette smoking causes acquired cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction and is associated with delayed mucociliary clearance and chronic bronchitis. Roflumilast is a clinically approved phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that improves lung function in patients with chronic bronchitis. We hypothesized that its therapeutic benefit was related in part to activation of CFTR. Primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, Calu-3, and T84 monolayers were exposed to whole cigarette smoke (WCS) or air with or without roflumilast treatment. CFTR-dependent ion transport was measured in modified Ussing chambers. Airway surface liquid (ASL) was determined by confocal microscopy. Intestinal fluid secretion of ligated murine intestine was monitored ex vivo. Roflumilast activated CFTR-dependent anion transport in normal HBE cells with a half maximal effective concentration of 2.9 nM. Roflumilast partially restored CFTR activity in WCS-exposed HBE cells (5.3 ± 1.1 μA/cm(2) vs. 1.2 ± 0.2 μA/cm(2) [control]; P &lt; 0.05) and was additive with ivacaftor, a specific CFTR potentiator approved for the treatment of CF. Roflumilast improved the depleted ASL depth of HBE monolayers exposed to WCS (9.0 ± 3.1 μm vs. 5.6 ± 2.0 μm [control]; P &lt; 0.05), achieving 79% of that observed in air controls. CFTR activation by roflumilast also induced CFTR-dependent fluid secretion in murine intestine, increasing the wet:dry ratio and the diameter of ligated murine segments. Roflumilast activates CFTR-mediated anion transport in airway and intestinal epithelia via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent pathway and partially reverses the deleterious effects of WCS, resulting in augmented ASL depth. Roflumilast may benefit patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic bronchitis by activating CFTR, which may also underlie noninfectious diarrhea caused by roflumilast.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis is a single gene, autosomal recessive disorder, in which more than 1,900 mutations grouped into 6 classes have been described. It is an example a disease that could be well placed to benefit from personalised medicine. There are currently 2 very different approaches that aim to correct the basic defect: gene therapy, aimed at correcting the genetic alteration, and therapy aimed at correcting the defect in the CFTR protein. The latter is beginning to show promising results, with several molecules under development. Ataluren (PTC124) is a molecule designed to make the ribosomes become less sensitive to the premature stop codons responsible for class i mutations. Lumacaftor (VX-809) is a CFTR corrector directed at class ii mutations, among which Phe508del is the most frequent, with encouraging results. Ivacaftor (VX-770) is a potentiator, the only one marketed to date, which has shown good efficacy for the class iii mutation Gly551Asp in children over the age of 6 and adults. These drugs, or a combination of them, are currently undergoing various clinical trials for other less common genetic mutations. In the last 5 years, CFTR has been designated as a therapeutic target. Ivacaftor is the first drug to treat the basic defect in cystic fibrosis, but only provides a response in a small number of patients. New drugs capable of restoring the CFTR protein damaged by the most common mutations are required.\n",

      "The cystic fibrosis (CF) protein forms an anion channel in epithelial cells, and the absence or defective function of this channel results in the clinical manifestations of CF.

Ivacaftor is a drug that in vitro increases open time and transepithelial chloride transport in all 10 gating mutations, but it is approved for use only in patients with the G551D mutation. We report complete normalization of sweat chloride concentration and rapid clinical improvement over 6 weeks of treatment with ivacaftor in a patient with CF with the gating mutation S549N.

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting, multisystem disease characterized by thick viscous secretions leading to recurrent lung infections, bronchiectasis, and progressive deterioration in lung function. CF is caused by loss or dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein which is responsible for transepithelial chloride and water transport. Improved understanding of CFTR protein dysfunction has allowed the development of mutation-specific small-molecule compounds which directly target the underlying CFTR defect. Ivacaftor is the first licensed small-molecule compound for CF patients which targets the CFTR gating mutation Gly551Asp (previously termed G551D) and has the potential to be truly disease-modifying. Ivacaftor is an oral medication given twice daily and has shown benefit in terms of an increase in lung function, decreased sweat chloride, weight gain, improvement in patient-reported quality of life, and reduction in number of respiratory exacerbations in clinical trials. Although ivacaftor is currently only licensed for use in approximately 5% of the CF population (those who have at least one Gly551Asp mutation), the developmental pathway established by ivacaftor paves the way for other CFTR modulators that may benefit many more patients. In particular, a CFTR modulator for those with the Phe508del deletion (previously ∆F508) would allow 90% of the CF population to benefit from disease-modifying treatment.\n",
      "Ivacaftor (Kalydeco™) is a potentiator of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and is the first drug that treats an underlying cause of cystic fibrosis to be licensed for use. Ivacaftor increases the open probability (i.e. gating) of CFTR channels with the G551D mutation, thus enhancing chloride transport, and is indicated in a number of countries for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients aged ≥6 years who carry this mutation. This review focuses on pharmacological, clinical efficacy and tolerability data relevant to the use of ivacaftor in this indication. In two 48-week, double-blind, phase III trials in patients aged ≥12 (STRIVE) or 6-11 (ENVISION) years with cystic fibrosis and the G551D mutation, oral ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 h significantly improved lung function relative to placebo, when used in combination with standard care. Significant improvements in pulmonary exacerbation risk (in STRIVE) as well as bodyweight and some aspects of health-related quality of life (both studies) were also seen with the drug versus placebo. Moreover, the beneficial effects of ivacaftor on parameters such as lung function and bodyweight were maintained over up to 96 weeks of treatment in an ongoing open-label extension of these studies. Ivacaftor was generally well tolerated, with headache, oropharyngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection and nasal congestion being among the most common adverse events. Thus, ivacaftor expands the current treatment options for patients with cystic fibrosis who have the G551D mutation. Its potential for use in patients with other CFTR mutations is also of interest.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR protein is a chloride and bicarbonate channel that is critical for normal epithelial ion transport and hydration of epithelial surfaces. Current CF care is supportive, but recent breakthroughs have occurred with the advent of novel therapeutic strategies that assist the function of mutant CFTR proteins. The development and key clinical trial results of ivacaftor, a small molecule that targets gating defects in disease-causing CFTR mutations including G551D CFTR, are summarized in this review. The G551D mutation is reasonably common in the CF patient population and produces a CFTR protein that localizes normally to the plasma membrane, but fails to open in response to cellular cues. Ivacaftor treatment produces dramatic improvements in lung function, weight, lung disease stability, patient-reported outcomes, and CFTR biomarkers in patients with CF harboring the G551D CFTR mutation compared with placebo controls and patients with two copies of the common F508del CFTR mutation. The unprecedented success of ivacaftor treatment for the G551D CF patient population has generated excitement in the CF care community regarding the expansion of its use to other CF patient populations with primary or secondary gating defects.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disorder associated with defective hydration of lung airways due to the loss of chloride transport through the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR). CFTR contains two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory domain, and its channel assembly requires multiple interdomain contacts. The most common CF-causing mutation, F508del, occurs in NBD1 and results in misfolding and premature degradation of F508del-CFTR. VX-809 is an investigational CFTR corrector that partially restores CFTR function in people who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR. To identify the folding defect(s) in F508del-CFTR that must be repaired to treat CF, we explored the mechanism of VX-809 action. VX-809 stabilized an N-terminal domain in CFTR that contains only MSD1 and efficaciously restored function to CFTR forms that have missense mutations in MSD1. The action of VX-809 on MSD1 appears to suppress folding defects in F508del-CFTR by enhancing interactions among the NBD1, MSD1, and MSD2 domains. The ability of VX-809 to correct F508del-CFTR is enhanced when combined with mutations that improve F508del-NBD1 interaction with MSD2. These data suggest that the use of VX-809 in combination with an additional CFTR corrector that suppresses folding defects downstream of MSD1 may further enhance CFTR function in people with F508del-CFTR.\n",

      "Nasal potential difference (NPD) is used as a biomarker of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity. We evaluated methods to detect changes in chloride and sodium transport by NPD based on a secondary analysis of a Phase II CFTR-modulator study. Thirty-nine subjects with CF who also had the G551D-CFTR mutation were randomized to receive ivacaftor (Kalydeco™; also known as VX-770) in four doses or placebo twice daily for at least 14 days. All data were analyzed by a single investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment. We compared three analysis methods to determine the best approach to quantify changes in chloride and sodium transport: (1) the average of both nostrils; (2) the most-polarized nostril at each visit; and (3) the most-polarized nostril at screening carried forward. Parameters of ion transport included the PD change with zero chloride plus isoproterenol (CFTR activity), the basal PD, Ringer's PD, and change in PD with amiloride (measurements of ENaC activity), and the delta NPD (measuring CFTR and ENaC activity). The average and most-polarized nostril at each visit were most sensitive to changes in chloride and sodium transport, whereas the most-polarized nostril at screening carried forward was less discriminatory. Based on our findings, NPD studies should assess both nostrils rather than a single nostril. We also found that changes in CFTR activity were more readily detected than changes in ENaC activity, and that rigorous standardization was associated with relatively good within-subject reproducibility in placebo-treated subjects (± 2.8 mV). Therefore, we have confirmed an assay of reasonable reproducibility for detecting chloride-transport improvements in response to CFTR modulation.\n",

Herein, we assessed if VX-809 is additive or synergistic with genetic revertants of F508del-CFTR, other correctors, and low temperature to determine its MoA. We explored and integrated those various agents in combined treatments, showing how they add to each other to identify their complementary MoA upon correction of F508del-CFTR. Our experimental and modeling data, while compatible with putative binding of VX-809 to NBD1:ICL4 interface, also indicate scope for further synergistic F508del-CFTR correction by other compounds at distinct conformational sites/cellular checkpoints, thus suggesting requirement of combined therapies to fully rescue F508del-CFTR.\n",
      "The improvement over the last two decades in the treatment of cystic fibrosis led to an increase in life expectancy approaching 40 years at birth. Logically, the population of adult patients has been increasing and is currently 50% of patients followed in France. These therapeutic advances have justified the establishment in 2003 of a generalized neonatal screening for cystic fibrosis. The latest data of this screening show an incidence of CF of 1/5359 live births, far below the incidence of 1/2500 which was widely accepted twenty years ago. The performance of this screening is currently based on the dosage of trypsin immuno reactive, followed in case of exceeding the threshold of a search of the 30 most common mutations, can detect around 96% of 150 to 200 CF cases every year. Therefore, the possibility of a false negative of the screening cannot be excluded and evocative symptoms of cystic fibrosis, even for children born after 2003, will lead to prescribe a sweat test. While treatments available so far goal consequences of cystic fibrosis, a new therapeutic class to correct the functional defect of the mutated protein, called CFTR modulators, is emerging. Ivacaftor, leader of this new class, belonging to the category of &quot;CFTR potentiator&quot; got its access on the market in September 2012 for patients carrying the G551D mutation. New other molecules, named &quot;CFTR correctors&quot; which can have synergistic effect with ivacaftor and concern patients carrying the most common mutation--DF 508--are under development.\n",
      "Processing mutations that inhibit folding and trafficking of CFTR are the main cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). A potential CF therapy would be to repair CFTR processing mutants. It has been demonstrated that processing mutants of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), CFTR's sister protein, can be efficiently repaired by a drug-rescue mechanism. Many arginine suppressors that mimic drug-rescue have been identified in the P-gp transmembrane (TM) domains (TMDs) that rescue by forming hydrogen bonds with residues in adjacent helices to promote packing of the TM segments. To test if CFTR mutants could be repaired by a drug-rescue mechanism, we used truncation mutants to test if corrector VX-809 interacted with the TMDs. VX-809 was selected for study because it is specific for CFTR, it is the most effective corrector identified to date, but it has limited clinical benefit. Identification of the VX-809 target domain will help to develop correctors with improved clinical benefits. It was found that VX-809 rescued truncation mutants lacking the NBD2 and R domains. When the remaining domains (TMD1, NBD1, TMD2) were expressed as separate polypeptides, VX-809 only increased the stability of TMD1. We then performed arginine mutagenesis on TM6 in TMD1. Although the results showed that TM6 had distinct lipid and aqueous faces, CFTR was different from P-gp as no arginine promoted maturation of CFTR processing mutants. The results suggest that TMD1 contains a VX-809 binding site, but its mechanism differed from P-gp drug-rescue. We also report that V510D acts as a universal suppressor to rescue CFTR processing mutants.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a cAMP-regulated anion channel expressed primarily at the apical plasma membrane of secretory epithelia. Nearly 2000 mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified that cause disease by impairing its translation, cellular processing, and/or chloride channel gating. The fundamental premise of CFTR corrector and potentiator therapy for CF is that addressing the underlying defects in the cellular processing and chloride channel function of CF-causing mutant CFTR alleles will result in clinical benefit by addressing the basic defect underlying CF. Correctors are principally targeted at F508del cellular misprocessing, whereas potentiators are intended to restore cAMP-dependent chloride channel activity to mutant CFTRs at the cell surface.

We developed a phenotype-based high-throughput screen to identify small-molecule activators of human airway epithelial Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channels (CaCCs) for CF therapy. Unexpectedly, screening of ∼110,000 synthetic small molecules revealed an amino-carbonitrile-pyrazole, C(act)-A1, that activated CFTR but not CaCC Cl⁻ conductance. C(act)-A1 produced large and sustained CFTR Cl⁻ currents in CFTR-expressing Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells and in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, without increasing intracellular cAMP and in the absence of a cAMP agonist. C(act)-A1 produced linear whole-cell currents. C(act)-A1 also activated ΔF508-CFTR Cl⁻ currents in low temperature-rescued ΔF508-CFTR-expressing FRT cells and CF-HBE cells (from homozygous ΔF508 patients) in the absence of a cAMP agonist, and showed additive effects with forskolin. In contrast, N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide (VX-770) and genistein produced little or no ΔF508-CFTR Cl⁻ current in the absence of a cAMP agonist. In FRT cells expressing G551D-CFTR and in CF nasal polyp epithelial cells (from a heterozygous G551D/Y1092X-CFTR patient), C(act)-A1 produced little Cl⁻ current by itself but showed synergy with forskolin. The amino-carbonitrile-pyrazole C(act)-A1 identified here is unique among prior CFTR-activating compounds, as it strongly activated wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR in the absence of a cAMP agonist. Increasing ΔF508-CFTR Cl⁻ conductance by an &quot;activator,&quot; as defined by activation in the absence of cAMP stimulation, provides a novel strategy for CF therapy that is different from that of a &quot;potentiator,&quot; which requires cAMP elevation.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF), a severe genetic disease, is caused by mutations that alter the structure and function of CFTR, a plasma membrane channel permeable to chloride and bicarbonate. Defective anion transport in CF irreversibly damages the lungs, pancreas, liver, and other organs. CF mutations cause loss of CFTR function in multiple ways. In particular, class 3 mutations such as p.Gly551Asp strongly decrease the time spent by CFTR in the open state (gating defect). Instead, class 2 mutations impair the maturation of CFTR protein and its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (trafficking defect). The deletion of phenylalanine 508 (p.Phe508del), the most frequent mutation among CF patients (70-90 %), destabilizes the CFTR protein, thus causing both a trafficking and a gating defect. These two defects can be overcome with drug-like molecules generically called correctors and potentiators, respectively. The potentiator Kalydeco™ (also known as Ivacaftor or VX-770), developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, has been recently approved by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of CF patients carrying at least one CFTR allele with the p.Gly551Asp mutation (2-5 % of all patients). In contrast, the corrector VX-809, which significantly improves p.Phe508del-CFTR trafficking in vitro, is still under study in clinical trials. Because of multiple defects caused by the p.Phe508del mutation, it is probable that rescue of the mutant protein will require combined treatment with correctors having different mechanisms of action. This review evaluates the status of experimental and clinical research in pharmacotherapy for the CF basic defect.\n",
      "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation, ΔF508 in nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1), impairs cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-coupled domain folding, plasma membrane expression, function and stability. VX-809, a promising investigational corrector of ΔF508-CFTR misprocessing, has limited clinical benefit and an incompletely understood mechanism, hampering drug development. Given the effect of second-site suppressor mutations, robust ΔF508-CFTR correction most likely requires stabilization of NBD1 energetics and the interface between membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and NBD1, which are both established primary conformational defects. Here we elucidate the molecular targets of available correctors: class I stabilizes the NBD1-MSD1 and NBD1-MSD2 interfaces, and class II targets NBD2. Only chemical chaperones, surrogates of class III correctors, stabilize human ΔF508-NBD1. Although VX-809 can correct missense mutations primarily destabilizing the NBD1-MSD1/2 interface, functional plasma membrane expression of ΔF508-CFTR also requires compounds that counteract the NBD1 and NBD2 stability defects in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and intestinal organoids. Thus, the combination of structure-guided correctors represents an effective approach for cystic fibrosis therapy.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disease due to mutations in the (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel expressed at the surface of several epithelial cells. Defective function of the CFTR protein leads to a severe disease in which lung disease is the leading cause of death. Current treatments are symptomatic. Nevertheless, with specialist and holistic care in dedicated cystic fibrosis centres, the median survival has improved. But the average age of death remains 29 years. Innovative molecules aiming to correct the CFTR protein itself are under development. These will be personalised treatments depending on the genotype or the type of CFTR dysfunction. The first molecule, ivacaftor, has just been approved in Europe and the USA. Adults and children treated with ivacaftor in clinical trials had a 10% improvement in FEV1 that was maintained for more than a year. Although at present ivacaftor is approved for only a small percentage of patients, the therapeutic strategy of correcting CFTR protein has been proved a valid approach. Other molecules targeting other defects in the CFTR protein are under evaluation.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening disorder that affects over 30,000 people in the U.S. and 70,000 worldwide. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR is a chloride and bicarbonate channel and regulates several ion transporters at the epithelial cell membrane, controlling hydration or ionic composition of epithelial secretions. Management of CF is currently supportive, but recent advances in drug development have focused on therapies that assist mutant CFTR function. In the current review, we summarize the development and clinical experience with VX-770 (ivacaftor), a small molecule that increases CFTR chloride conductance in vitro and in vivo, including wild-type and G551D CFTR. The G551D CFTR mutation is the third most common CF disease-causing mutation, in which the CFTR protein localizes to the epithelial cell membrane but has defective gating. With restoration of adequate CFTR function through pharmacotherapy, it is possible that the clinical course of patients with CF could be markedly improved, including longevity, quality of life and treatment burden.\n",
      "Ivacaftor is a new therapeutic agent that acts at the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel to alter activity. It is approved for use in patients 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis who have at least 1 G551D mutation in the CFTR gene. It is unlike any other current pharmacologic agent for cystic fibrosis in that it specifically targets the gene defect associated with cystic fibrosis as opposed to treating resulting symptomology. Mucoactive agents, antibiotics, inhaled beta agonists, and other anti-inflammatory agents are currently the mainstay of cystic fibrosis treatment but can be associated with several side effects in addition to cumbersome frequency of administration. Ivacaftor's oral dosing regimen offers a more convenient treatment option. However, it is associated with significant drug-drug interactions.\n",

      "Mutations in the SLC4A1 gene encoding the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) can cause distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), a disease often due to mis-trafficking of the mutant protein. In this study, we investigated whether trafficking of a Golgi-retained dRTA mutant, G701D kAE1, or two dRTA mutants retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, C479W and R589H kAE1, could be functionally rescued to the plasma membrane of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Treatments with DMSO, glycerol, the corrector VX-809, or low temperature incubations restored the basolateral trafficking of G701D kAE1 mutant. These treatments had no significant rescuing effect on trafficking of the mis-folded C479W or R589H kAE1 mutants. DMSO was the only treatment that partially restored G701D kAE1 function in the plasma membrane of MDCK cells. Our experiments show that trafficking of intracellularly retained dRTA kAE1 mutants can be partially restored, and that one chemical treatment rescued both trafficking and function of a dRTA mutant. These studies provide an opportunity to develop alternative therapeutic solutions for dRTA patients.\n",
      "Stratified approaches to treating disease are very attractive, as efficacy is maximised by identifying responders using a companion diagnostic or by careful phenotyping. This approach will spare non-responders form potential side-effects. This has been pioneered in oncology where single genes or gene signatures indicate tumours that will respond to specific chemotherapies. Stratified approaches to the treatment of asthma with biological therapies are currently being extensively studied. In cystic fibrosis (CF), therapies have been developed that are targeted at specific functional classes of mutations. Ivacaftor, the first of such therapies, potentiates dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein Class III mutations and is now available in the USA and some European countries. Pivotal studies in patients with a G551D mutation, the most common Class III mutation, have demonstrated significant improvements in clinically important outcomes such as spirometry and exacerbations. Sweat chloride was significantly reduced demonstrating a functional effect on the dysfunctional CFTR protein produced by the G551D mutation. Symptom scores are also greatly improved to a level that indicates that this is a transformational treatment for many patients. This stratified approach to the development of therapies based on the functional class of the mutations in CF is likely to lead to new drugs or combinations that will correct the basic defect in many patients with CF.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive lethal disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes for CFTR, an epithelial cell-surface expressed protein responsible for the transport of chloride (Cl(-)). Gating mutations associated with defective conductance can be modulated by CFTR potentiators. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator approved for the treatment of CF patients &gt;6 yrs of age with at least one copy of the G551D-CFTR mutation. Herein, the clinical trial development programme for ivacaftor will be reviewed, including two pivotal studies in adolescents/adults and in children. These studies report sustained improvements in lung function and sweat chloride concentrations, and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations over a 48-week treatment period. In the era of personalised medicine, ivacaftor offers an effective and well-tolerated treatment for the clinical management of CF patients with the G551D mutation. A long-term, open-label study will report the effects of ivacaftor over a further 48 weeks.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by genetic mutations that affect the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. These mutations can impact the synthesis and transfer of the CFTR protein to the apical membrane of epithelial cells, as well as influencing the gating or conductance of chloride and bicarbonate ions through the channel. CFTR dysfunction results in ionic imbalance of epithelial secretions in several organ systems, such as the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, liver and the respiratory system. Since discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989, research has focussed on targeting the underlying genetic defect to identify a disease-modifying treatment for CF. Investigated management strategies have included gene therapy and the development of small molecules that target CFTR mutations, known as CFTR modulators. CFTR modulators are typically identified by high-throughput screening assays, followed by preclinical validation using cell culture systems. Recently, one such modulator, the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor, was approved as an oral therapy for CF patients with the G551D-CFTR mutation. The clinical development of ivacaftor not only represents a breakthrough in CF care but also serves as a noteworthy example of personalised medicine.\n",
      "Vx-770 (Ivacaftor), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for clinical application to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), shifts the paradigm from conventional symptomatic treatments to therapeutics directly tackling the root of the disease: functional defects of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel caused by pathogenic mutations. The underlying mechanism for the action of Vx-770 remains elusive partly because this compound not only increases the activity of wild-type (WT) channels whose gating is primarily controlled by ATP binding/hydrolysis, but also improves the function of G551D-CFTR, a disease-associated mutation that abolishes CFTR's responsiveness to ATP. Here we provide a unified theory to account for this dual effect of Vx-770. We found that Vx-770 enhances spontaneous, ATP-independent activity of WT-CFTR to a similar magnitude as its effects on G551D channels, a result essentially explaining Vx-770's effect on G551D-CFTR. Furthermore, Vx-770 increases the open time of WT-CFTR in an [ATP]-dependent manner. This distinct kinetic effect is accountable with a newly proposed CFTR gating model depicting an [ATP]-dependent &quot;reentry&quot; mechanism that allows CFTR shuffling among different open states by undergoing multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis. We further examined the effect of Vx-770 on R352C-CFTR, a unique mutant that allows direct observation of hydrolysis-triggered gating events. Our data corroborate that Vx-770 increases the open time of WT-CFTR by stabilizing a posthydrolytic open state and thereby fosters decoupling between the gating cycle and ATP hydrolysis cycle. The current study also suggests that this unique mechanism of drug action can be further exploited to develop strategies that enhance the function of CFTR.\n",

      "We report on an adult with cystic fibrosis (ΔF508/G551D) with severe lung disease (forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in one second 24% predicted) who was admitted for a pulmonary exacerbation. He was managed with maximal medical therapy, but did not have significant improvement until after he was started on ivacaftor on hospital day 15. He subsequently had significant improvement in lung function with normalization of hypercarbia, oxygen saturation on room air, and increase in FEV1 to 36% predicted. Prior to use of ivacaftor he was being assessed for a lung transplant. However, after ivacaftor therapy for 6 months, he is no longer considering this treatment modality due to his improvement of lung function and functional status.\n",

      "A great deal of excitement and hope has followed the successful trials and US Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug ivacaftor (Kalydeco), the first therapy available that targets the underlying defect that causes cystic fibrosis (CF). Although this drug has currently demonstrated a clinical benefit for a small minority of the CF population, the developmental pathway established by ivacaftor paves the way for other CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators that may benefit many more patients. In addition to investigating CFTR modulators, researchers are actively developing numerous other innovative CF therapies. In this review, we use the catalog of treatments currently under evaluation with the support of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, known as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Pipeline, as a platform to discuss the variety of candidate treatments for CF lung disease that promise to improve CF care. Many of these approaches target the individual components of the relentless cycle of airway obstruction, inflammation, and infection characteristic of lung disease in CF, whereas others are aimed directly at the gene defect, or the resulting dysfunctional protein, that instigates this cycle. We discuss how new findings from the laboratory have informed not only the development of novel therapeutics, but also the rationales for their use and the outcomes used to measure their effects. By reviewing the breadth of candidate treatments currently in development, as well as the recent progress in CF therapies reflected by the evolution of the therapeutics pipeline over the past few years, we hope to build upon the optimism and anticipation generated by the recent success of Kalydeco.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening inherited disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), which encodes for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel that regulates chloride and water transport across the surface of epithelial cells. Ivacaftor, a drug recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, represents the first mutation-specific therapy for CF. It is a CFTR channel modulator and improves CFTR function in patients with CF who have a G551D mutation. A clinical trial performed to support ivacaftor dose selection demonstrated a dose-response relationship between improvement in FEV(1) and decrease in sweat chloride, a measure of CFTR function. Validation of such a relationship between FEV(1) and sweat chloride would facilitate development of new drugs that target the defective CFTR. Subsequently, in phase 3 studies, ivacaftor 150 mg bid resulted in significant improvements in FEV(1) (10%-12%) and reduction in sweat chloride (approximately 50 mmol/L). However, a decrease in sweat chloride did not correlate with improvement in FEV(1), nor did there appear to be a threshold level for change in sweat chloride above which an improvement in FEV(1) was apparent. The lack of correlation of sweat chloride with improvement in FEV(1) speaks to the multiplicity of factors, physiologic, environmental, and genetic, that likely modulate CF disease severity. Future clinical trials of drugs that are directed to the defective CFTR will need take into account the uncertainty of using even established measurements, such as sweat chloride, as clinical end points.\n",
      "There is a need to find a cure for pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis (CF), though full benefit of this approach will be restricted to those patients with well-preserved lungs. The most promising route is currently that of a pharmacological mutation-specific approach aiming at correcting the mechanism by which mutations lead to impairment of chloride conductance across respiratory epithelial cells. In the past 14years, 7 candidate drugs (CPX, 4PBA, gentamicin, PTC124, VX-770 or Ivacaftor, VX-809 or Lumacaftor, and Miglustat) have been investigated in CF patients. A postulate of 14 out of the 15 published studies has been that an effective agent had to improve total chloride secretion as assessed in vivo by nasal potential difference measurements. The present review casts a critical look at these studies. Apparent inconsistencies are discussed as well as possible limitations of nasal potential difference measurements as outcome parameters in these trials. Primarily targeting a mutation carried by less than 2% of French CF patients, the 2 Ivacaftor studies could well be a milestone on the long road toward a cure for CF. However, further data on safety and long-term efficacy are obviously needed and the current price of this medication in the US would make it unaffordable for European patients.\n",
      "Most cystic fibrosis is caused by the deletion of a single amino acid (F508) from CFTR and the resulting misfolding and destabilization of the protein. Compounds identified by high-throughput screening to improve ΔF508 CFTR maturation have already entered clinical trials, and it is important to understand their mechanisms of action to further improve their efficacy. Here, we showed that several of these compounds, including the investigational drug VX-809, caused a much greater increase (5- to 10-fold) in maturation at 27 than at 37°C (&lt;2-fold), and the mature product remained short-lived (T(1/2)∼4.5 h) and thermally unstable, even though its overall conformational state was similar to wild type, as judged by resistance to proteolysis and interdomain cross-linking. Consistent with its inability to restore thermodynamic stability, VX-809 stimulated maturation 2-5-fold beyond that caused by several different stabilizing modifications of NBD1 and the NBD1/CL4 interface. The compound also promoted maturation of several disease-associated processing mutants on the CL4 side of this interface. Although these effects may reflect an interaction of VX-809 with this interface, an interpretation supported by computational docking, it also rescued maturation of mutants in other cytoplasmic loops, either by allosteric effects or via additional sites of action. In addition to revealing the capabilities and some of the limitations of this important investigational drug, these findings clearly demonstrate that ΔF508 CFTR can be completely assembled and evade cellular quality control systems, while remaining thermodynamically unstable. He, L., Kota, P., Aleksandrov, A. A., Cui, L., Jensen, T., Dokholyan, N. V., Riordan, J. R. Correctors of ΔF508 CFTR restore global conformational maturation without thermally stabilizing the mutant protein.\n",

      "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) acts as a channel on the apical membrane of epithelia. Disease-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene can lead to CFTR protein misfolding as in the case of the F508del mutation and/or channel dysfunction. Recently, a small molecule, VX-770 (ivacaftor), has shown efficacy in restoring lung function in patients bearing the G551D mutation, and this has been linked to repair of its channel gating defect. However, these studies did not reveal the mechanism of action of VX-770 in detail. Normally, CFTR channel activity is regulated by phosphorylation, ATP binding, and hydrolysis. Hence, it has been hypothesized that VX-770 modifies one or more of these metabolic events. In this study, we examined VX-770 activity using a reconstitution system for purified CFTR protein, a system that enables control of known regulatory factors. We studied the consequences of VX-770 interaction with CFTR incorporated in planar lipid bilayers and in proteoliposomes, using a novel flux-based assay. We found that purified and phosphorylated CFTR was potentiated in the presence of Mg-ATP, suggesting that VX-770 bound directly to the CFTR protein, rather than associated kinases or phosphatases. Interestingly, we also found that VX-770 enhanced the channel activity of purified and mutant CFTR in the nominal absence of Mg-ATP. These findings suggest that VX-770 can cause CFTR channel opening through a nonconventional ATP-independent mechanism. This work sets the stage for future studies of the structural properties that mediate CFTR gating using VX-770 as a probe.\n",
      "Although affecting only 4-5% of those with cystic fibrosis (CF), the G551D-CFTR mutation is the target of the recently approved 'orphan drug', ivacaftor. The promise of such genomically guided therapies heralds a new era in the management of CF. A phase 3 trial demonstrated significant improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) from baseline, average weight gain, concentration in sweat chloride and reductions in pulmonary exacerbations [Ramsey, B.W., et al. A CFTR potentiator in patients with CF and the G551D mutation. N. Engl. J. Med., 2011. 365: 1663-1672.)]. Ivacaftor is among a group of recently approved, novel, mutation guided 'orphan drug' therapies that have established clinical benefits within their respective disease categories. They do not, however, offer a cure. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies have leveraged the incentivized benefits of the Orphan Drug Act to develop more of these drugs for orphan disorders affecting populations of &lt;200 000 patients. With marked clinical efficacy via DNA sequence guidance, these drugs have also set a precedent in terms of the substantial annual costs and if this trend continues, such expenditures may become unsustainable. This paper explores the genomic pathophysiology of CF and how therapies such as ivacaftor provide benefit to those with the disease but at a considerably elevated price point.\n",
      "In patients with cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) biomarkers, such as sweat chloride concentration and/or nasal potential difference, are used as end-points of efficacy in phase-III clinical trials with the disease modifying drugs ivacaftor (VX-770), VX809 and ataluren. The aim of this project was to review the literature on reliability, validity and responsiveness of nasal potential difference, sweat chloride and intestinal current measurement in patients with cystic fibrosis. Data on clinimetric properties were collected for each biomarker and reviewed by an international team of experts. Data on reliability, validity and responsiveness were tabulated. In addition, narrative answers to four key questions were discussed and agreed by the team of experts. The data collected demonstrated the reliability, validity and responsiveness of nasal potential difference. Fewer data were found on reliability of sweat chloride concentration; however, validity and responsiveness were demonstrated. Validity was demonstrated for intestinal current measurement, but further information is required on reliability and responsiveness. For all three end-points, normal values were collected and further research requirements were proposed. This body of work adds useful information to support the promotion of CFTR biomarkers to surrogate end-points and to guide further research in the area.\n",
      "Chronic airway inflammation is a hallmark of chronic obstructive airway diseases, including asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and CF (cystic fibrosis). It is also a major challenge in delivery and therapeutic efficacy of nano-based delivery systems in these chronic airway conditions as nanoparticle (NP) need to bypass airways defense mechanisms as we recently discussed. NPs which are capable of overcoming airways defense mechanisms should allow targeted drug delivery to disease cells. Over the last decade there has been increasing interest in development of targeted NPs for cancer but relatively little effort on designing novel systems for treating chronic inflammatory and obstructive airway conditions. Here we describe methods for preparing drug loaded multifunctional nanoparticles for targeted delivery to specific cell types in airways. The formulations and methods for selective drug delivery, discussed here are currently under preclinical development in our laboratory for treating chronic airway conditions such as COPD, CF, and asthma.\n",

      "Life expectancy in cystic fibrosis (CF) has improved substantially over the last 75 years, with a median predicted survival now approaching 40 years. This improvement has resulted largely from therapies treating end-organ manifestations. In an effort to develop drugs that would target the underlying defects in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation embarked on a bold initiative in which it established collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies to support early-stage efforts to discover new medicines for CF. This has led to the development and clinical trial testing of several novel drugs targeting specific CFTR mutations. One drug, ivacaftor, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the approximately 4% of patients with CF who have the G551D gating mutation. Drugs targeting F508del CFTR and premature termination codons, which would be applicable to 90% of patients with CF, are undergoing clinical trials. The impact of such drugs on CFTR biomarkers, such as sweat chloride and nasal potential difference, suggests that they may reset the clinical trajectory of CF, but their effect on long-term outcomes will remain unknown for many years. Nevertheless, development of CFTR-targeted drugs represents an important milestone in CF, perhaps revolutionizing the care of these patients in a fundamental way.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-threatening recessively inherited disease in Caucasians. Due to early provision of care in specialized reference centers and more comprehensive care, survival has improved over time. Despite great advances in supportive care and in our understanding of its pathophysiology, there is still no cure for the disease. Therapeutic strategies aimed at rescuing the abnormal protein are either being sought after or under investigation. This review highlights salient insights into pathophysiology and candidate molecules suitable for CFTR pharmacotherapy. Clinical trials using Ataluren, VX-809 and ivacaftor have provided encouraging data. Preclinical data with inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5, such as sildenafil and analogs, have highlighted their potential for CFTR pharmacotherapy. Because sildenafil and analogs are in clinical use for other clinical applications, research on this class of drugs might speed up the development of new therapies for CF.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that impair the function of CFTR, an epithelial chloride channel required for proper function of the lung, pancreas, and other organs. Most patients with CF carry the F508del CFTR mutation, which causes defective CFTR protein folding and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in minimal amounts of CFTR at the cell surface. One strategy to treat these patients is to correct the processing of F508del-CFTR with small molecules. Here we describe the in vitro pharmacology of VX-809, a CFTR corrector that was advanced into clinical development for the treatment of CF. In cultured human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from patients with CF homozygous for F508del, VX-809 improved F508del-CFTR processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced chloride secretion to approximately 14% of non-CF human bronchial epithelial cells (EC(50), 81 ± 19 nM), a level associated with mild CF in patients with less disruptive CFTR mutations. F508del-CFTR corrected by VX-809 exhibited biochemical and functional characteristics similar to normal CFTR, including biochemical susceptibility to proteolysis, residence time in the plasma membrane, and single-channel open probability. VX-809 was more efficacious and selective for CFTR than previously reported CFTR correctors. VX-809 represents a class of CFTR corrector that specifically addresses the underlying processing defect in F508del-CFTR.\n",
      "Mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) cause CF (cystic fibrosis), a fatal genetic disease commonly leading to airway obstruction with recurrent airway inflammation and infection. Pulmonary obstruction in CF has been linked to the loss of CFTR function as a regulated Cl- channel on the lumen-facing membrane of the epithelium lining the airways. We have learned much about the molecular basis for nucleotide- and phosphorylation-dependent regulation of channel activity of the normal (wild-type) version of the CFTR protein through electrophysiological studies. The major CF-causing mutation, F508del-CFTR, causes the protein to misfold and be retained in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). Importantly, recent studies in cell culture have shown that retention in the ER can be 'corrected' through the application of certain small-molecule modulators and, once at the surface, the altered channel function of the major mutant can be 'potentiated', pharmacologically. Importantly, two such small molecules, a 'corrector' (VX-809) and a 'potentiator' (VX-770) compound are undergoing clinical trial for the treatment of CF. In this chapter, we describe recent discoveries regarding the wild-type CFTR and F508del-CFTR protein, in the context of molecular models based on X-ray structures of prokaryotic ABC (ATP-binding cassette) proteins. Finally, we discuss the promise of small-molecule modulators to probe the relationship between structure and function in the wild-type protein, the molecular defects caused by the most common mutation and the structural changes required to correct these defects.\n",

      "Modulator compounds intended to overcome disease-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) show significant promise in clinical testing for cystic fibrosis. However, the mechanism(s) of action underlying these compounds are not fully understood. Activation of CFTR ion transport requires PKA-regulated phosphorylation of the regulatory domain (R-D) and dimerization of the nucleotide binding domains. Using a newly developed assay, we evaluated nine compounds including both CFTR potentatiators and activators discovered via various high-throughput screening strategies to acutely augment CFTR activity. We found considerable differences in the effects on R-D phosphorylation. Some (including UC(CF)-152) stimulated robust phosphorylation, and others had little effect (e.g., VRT-532 and VX-770). We then compared CFTR activation by UC(CF)-152 and VRT-532 in Ussing chamber studies using two epithelial models, CFBE41o(-) and Fischer rat thyroid cells, expressing various CFTR forms. UC(CF)-152 activated wild-type-, G551D-, and rescued F508del-CFTR currents but did not potentiate cAMP-mediated CFTR activation. In contrast, VRT-532 moderately activated CFTR short-circuit current and strongly potentiated forskolin-mediated current. Combined with the result that UC(CF)-152, but not VRT-532 or VX-770, acts by increasing CFTR R-D phosphorylation, these findings indicate that potentiation of endogenous cAMP-mediated activation of mutant CFTR is not due to a pathway involving augmented R-D phosphorylation. This study presents an assay useful to distinguish preclinical compounds by a crucial mechanism underlying CFTR activation, delineates two types of compound able to acutely augment CFTR activity (e.g., activators and potentiators), and demonstrates that a number of different mechanisms can be successfully employed to activate mutant CFTR.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that cause loss of function of the CFTR channel on the apical surface of epithelial cells. The major CF-causing mutation, F508del-CFTR, is misfolded, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and degraded. Small molecule corrector compounds have been identified using high throughput screens, which partially rescue the trafficking defect of F508del-CFTR, allowing a fraction of the mutant protein to escape endoplasmic reticulum retention and traffic to the plasma membrane, where it exhibits partial function as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. A subset of such corrector compounds binds directly to the mutant protein, prompting the hypothesis that they rescue the biosynthetic defect by inducing improved protein conformation. We tested this hypothesis directly by evaluating the consequences of a corrector compound on the conformation of each nucleotide binding domain (NBD) in the context of the full-length mutant protein in limited proteolytic digest studies. Interestingly, we found that VRT-325 was capable of partially restoring compactness in NBD1. However, VRT-325 had no detectable effect on the conformation of the second half of the molecule. In comparison, ablation of the di-arginine sequence, R(553)XR(555) (F508del-KXK-CFTR), modified protease susceptibility of NBD1, NBD2, and the full-length protein. Singly, each intervention led to a partial correction of the processing defect. Together, these interventions restored processing of F508del-CFTR to near wild type. Importantly, however, a defect in NBD1 conformation persisted, as did a defect in channel activation after the combined interventions. Importantly, this defect in channel activation can be fully corrected by the addition of the potentiator, VX-770.\n",

      "We analyse a paper, which reports an entirely novel approach to the treatment of cystic fibrosis, consisting in &quot;repairing&quot; the defective mutant protein. Patients with cystic fibrosis have a mutation of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an epithelial chloride channel involved in salt and fluid transport in multiple organs, including the lungs and pancreas. The mutations have different effects on the CFTR protein, such as misfolding for the ΔF508 mutation (the most common), or defective opening of the chloride channel for the G551D-CFTR mutation, found in 4 to 5% of the patients. The authors of this work have shown that VX-770, an agent known previously to increase the activity of wild-type and G551D-CFTR cell surface protein in vitro, was able, when given orally to 39 cystic fibrosis patients during 14 and 28 days, to partially restore chloride conductance, as measured by nasal epithelium potential difference. Similarly, the agent partially restored chloride transport in sweat glands, as measured by the sweat chloride concentration. Clinically, VX-770 increased the forced expiratory volume per second (FEVi). Side effects included macular skin rash, elevation of blood glucose concentration and glycosuria. All side effects resolved after discontinuation of the drug. VX-770 has also been shown to increase the activity of ΔF508-CFTR channels in vitro, provided they reach the cell surface. This study appears to be a milestone in the treatment of cystic fibrosis and possibly other genetic diseases.\n",

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein kinase A (PKA)-activated epithelial anion channel involved in salt and fluid transport in multiple organs, including the lung. Most CF mutations either reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell surface (e.g., synthesis or processing mutations) or impair channel function (e.g., gating or conductance mutations) or both. There are currently no approved therapies that target CFTR. Here we describe the in vitro pharmacology of VX-770, an orally bioavailable CFTR potentiator in clinical development for the treatment of CF. In recombinant cells VX-770 increased CFTR channel open probability (P(o)) in both the F508del processing mutation and the G551D gating mutation. VX-770 also increased Cl(-) secretion in cultured human CF bronchial epithelia (HBE) carrying the G551D gating mutation on one allele and the F508del processing mutation on the other allele by approximately 10-fold, to approximately 50% of that observed in HBE isolated from individuals without CF. Furthermore, VX-770 reduced excessive Na(+) and fluid absorption to prevent dehydration of the apical surface and increased cilia beating in these epithelial cultures. These results support the hypothesis that pharmacological agents that restore or increase CFTR function can rescue epithelial cell function in human CF airway.\n",
      "There are a number of potential drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) currently undergoing clinical studies. A number of antibacterials formulated for delivery by inhalation are at various stages of study; these include dry-powder inhaler versions of colistin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, and formulations of azteonam, amikacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and fosfomycin/tobramycin for nebulization. Clinical trials of anti-inflammatory agents, including glutathione, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, oral acetylcysteine, simvastatin, methotrexate, docosahexaenoic acid, hydroxychloroquine, pioglitazone and alpha1-antitrypsin, are ongoing. Ion channel modulating agents, such as lancovutide (Moli1901, duramycin) and denufosol, which activate alternate (non-CF transmembrane regulator [CFTR]) chloride channels, and GS 9411, a sodium channel antagonist, are now at the stages of clinical study and if successful, will offer a new category of therapeutic agent for the treatment of CF. Correction of the underlying gene effect, either by agents that help to correct the dysfunctional CFTR, such as ataluren, VX-770 and VX-809, or by gene transfer (gene therapy), is a particularly exciting prospect as a new therapy for CF and clinical studies are ongoing. This article reviews the exciting potential drug treatments for CF currently being evaluated in clinical studies, and also highlights some of the challenges faced by research and clinical teams in assessing the efficacy of potential new therapies for CF.\n",
